## What are the 3 major systems used in industrial automation?

Automation has become a fundamental aspect of running a small business efficiently in today's digital era. The three major systems typically used for small business automation include Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems, Content Management Systems (CMS), and Email Marketing automation tools.

In the era of "do more with less," these tools can help you streamline workflows, organize data, and ultimately free up time to focus on your unique value propositionâ€”the heart and soul of your business. Let's take a closer look.

## Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems

CRM systems, like Salesforce or Zoho CRM, are multi-functional tools designed to streamline and manage all aspects of customer relations. They can automate tasks such as contact management, lead tracking, and sales pipeline monitoring. 

However, it's important to remember that while CRM systems offer various functionalities, the key is to understand your unique business needs. A simpler, custom solution might often be more effective than a packaged, "all-in-one" tool.

### Key Features of CRM Systems

 * Lead and contact management
 * Sales tracking
 * Email integration
 * Task automation

## Content Management Systems (CMS)

CMS tools, such as WordPress or Squarespace, are excellent for managing and automating content-related tasks. They help businesses maintain their online presence and streamline their content creation and publishing processes.

Once again, remember that no two businesses are the same. Your CMS should match your individual needs, and sometimes a simpler bespoke solution might work better than a comprehensive, "all-in-one" platform.

### Key Features of CMS Tools

 * Content creation and publishing
 * SEO optimization
 * Site management
 * Integration with other platforms

## Email Marketing Automation Tools

Email is still one of the most effective means of marketing. Automation tools like Mailchimp or Sendinblue help manage email campaigns, sending out newsletters, and following up with customers. 

However, navigating the vast ocean of email marketing tools can be daunting. An external consultant could quickly and cost-efficiently help to match your business with the most suitable and efficient tool.

### Key Features of Email Marketing Tools

 * Email campaign management 
 * A/B Testing 
 * Analytics and reporting 
 * Subscriber segmentation

## An Outside Perspective

<blockquote>
"The automation needs of every business are unique. It requires a unique touch to identify new opportunities for improvement and deliver the best possible value. Engaging with an outside opinion can significantly help evaluate and assess your business's unique needs."
</blockquote>

Automation tools are certainly a boon, saving time, and increasing efficiency. But, they are not universal solutions. More often than not, a third-party consulting with an outsider's perspective can help assess your individual business needs more effectively. 

## Wrapping Up

The right tools can drastically alter how you manage day-to-day tasks, allowing you to focus more on what sets your business apart. CRM systems, CMS tools, and Email Marketing automation are essential assets. But remember, your approach towards automating processes should not be a one-size-fits-all solution. Having an outside perspective can help identify new opportunities and truly leverage the power of automation.

Remember, simplicity is often the best way forward in our complex world.

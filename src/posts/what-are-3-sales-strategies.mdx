## What are 3 Sales Strategies?

Whether you're a fledgling entrepreneur or a seasoned business owner, sales strategies are the bread and butter of your business's sustainability and growth. Today, we're going to deep dive into three key strategies that will boost your sales: Building Relationships, Leveraging Online Platforms, and Providing Outstanding Customer Service. But remember, these aren't just 'plug-and-play' formulas. They require analysis, implementation, and continuous optimization. 

However, before digging into the nuts and bolts of these strategies, let's pause to ponder some preliminary questions: What unique value is your business providing? How well are you communicating this to your audience?

## Building Relationships

Business is not just about transactions; it's about relationships. Building strong bonds both with your existing customers and potential ones is key to long-term customer retention, which is cost-effective compared to acquiring new customers. 

Creating trust and rapport requires genuine interest in clients’ needs. Remember, your customers are not just purchasing a product or service, they’re investing in a customer experience.

### Key Tactics in Building Relationships

 * Engage in two-way communication with the client.
 * Be honest and transparent about your products and services.
 * Prioritize customer service and after-sales support.
 * Encourage customer feedback and be responsive.

## Leveraging Online Platforms

The digital age has opened up opportunities for small businesses that were unimaginable a decade ago. Through social media platforms, businesses now have a direct line to their customers. Going online can significantly enhance your visibility and reach, but it requires strategic planning and skill.

Crafting an effective digital presence demands more than just setting up social media profiles. It's about engagement and providing value in every interaction.

### Key Tactics for Leveraging Online Platforms

 * Optimize your business’s online profiles for search engines.
 * Regularly publish high-value content relevant to your products/services.
 * Engage with your online community through comments and messages.
 * Explore targeted ads to reach a larger audience.

## Providing Outstanding Customer Service

What sets apart great businesses from the rest is outstanding customer service. By being responsive, empathetic, and solution-driven, your business sends a strong message that you value your customers and their experiences. This strategy goes hand in hand with building strong relationships.

Outstanding customer service creates trust, enhances your brand's reputation, and promotes customer loyalty. It can turn a one-time customer into a long-term client and free advertiser.

### Key Tactics for Delivering Outstanding Customer Service

 * Train your team to be customer-centric.
 * Respond quickly and efficiently to customer queries and complaints.
 * Go the extra mile to deliver more than what the customer expected.
 * Solicit and utilize customer feedback to improve your services.

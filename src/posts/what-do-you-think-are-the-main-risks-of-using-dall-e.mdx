## Dependency on AI

Businesses that heavily rely on DALL-E or similar AI solutions could face challenges if the technology fails or ceases to exist. 

Small, in-house teams may struggle to swiftly resolve these issues due to their limited knowledge of AI.

 * Business continuity threats

## Misuse of AI

The misuse or irresponsible handling of AI tools like DALL-E can lead to unintentional harm or damage to a small business's reputation. 

Moreover, user generated content, powered by AI, can be manipulated to create untrue or offensive content.

### Important Misuse Considerations

 * Negative impact on brand reputation
 * Irresponsible handling of technology 
 * Potential of AI-powered cyber attacks
 * Inaccurate or distorted user generated content

## Security and Privacy

Artificial intelligence platforms like DALL-E often involve the processing of large data sets, which can introduce significant security and privacy risks.

Sensitive customer data could be exposed if the systems are not secure enough, potentially damaging the business's reputation and leading to legal issues.

### Core Security and Privacy Risks

 * Data security vulnerabilities
 * Potential data breaches
 * Liability for customer data

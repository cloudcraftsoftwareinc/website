## What Should Not Be Automated?

Automation, when leveraged correctly, can prove incredibly beneficial for small businesses by handling mundane and repetitive tasks efficiently. However, not everything should be automated. The very essence of what makes a small business unique - personal relationships, creativity, and problem-solving - must still be a human endeavor.

As we take a closer look at this topic, the question beckons: How can we strike a balance between efficiency and authenticity in automation?

## Understanding Automation

Automation might seem like a magic trick, turning dreaded repetitive tasks into seamless processes. When automation is implemented shrewdly, it can indeed save business owners a substantial amount of time, allowing them to focus on creative pursuits, and expanding their businesses.

However, blindfolded automation can also strip a business of its unique touch. It's crucial to add that sprinkle of human element in business interactions to distinguish oneself in this gritty competitive market.

### The Four Elements to Keep Human

 * Customer Relationship Management
 * Content Creation
 * High-Level Decision Making
 * Conflict Resolution
  
## Importance of Human in Automation 

Expounding on the above elements: Customer Relationship Management (CRM) relies heavily on authentic human connections. Automation may help keep track of communication; however, personal interactions secure customer loyalty, a paramount facet for small businesses.

Content creation is another sphere demanding an essential human touch. While automation tools like Buffer or Hootsuite are exceptional for scheduling, the creativity, wit, and emotional intelligence required for impactful content creation cannot be automated.

## Tackling Automation

<blockquote>Approach automation as a facilitator, not as a replacement for the human element</blockquote>

High-level decision-making and conflict resolution are domains demanding critical problem-solving skills, empathy, and context-aware decision-making, traits yet unperturbed by AI. Misplaced reliance on automation for these tasks could lead to a loss in business value.

Business owners must eye automation as a method to assist human efforts, not replace them. 

## Weighing in Pros and Cons 

Lastly, it's crucial to weigh in the pros and cons before diving headlong into automation. It’s important to remember tools like Salesforce for CRM or QuickBooks for financial management may offer automation, but they don't match the unique nature of every business.

### Skimming through Automation Tools

 * Salesforce for CRM
 * QuickBooks for Finance Management
 * Buffer for Social Media Scheduling
 * Mailchimp for Email Marketing 

## Wrapping Up

Technology has been aiding businesses to cross boundaries and scale new heights. It’s pivotal in enhancing efficiency but must be sagely tuned to retain the human aspect in business. However, as individual as every small business is, their journey with automation would be unique and require a discerning mindset.
    
Just remember the business's warmth, intuition, and creativity cannot be automated. So, next time when you ponder - "What should not be automated?", remember, it’s the human touch that makes your business stand out in the crowd.

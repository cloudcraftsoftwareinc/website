In a small business setting, it can free up valuable time, allowing owner/operators to focus on more strategic aspects of their business. Some examples of process automation within a small business context could include automatic appointment scheduling or email marketing management. 

Digging deeper, there are various tools and technologies available that cater specifically to the automation needs of small businesses. Yet, it's important to remember that each business is unique, and their automating needs will differ based on their specific requirements and operations.

An outsider's perspective can help in evaluating your individual needs and guiding you towards a beneficial and cost-effective automation approach.

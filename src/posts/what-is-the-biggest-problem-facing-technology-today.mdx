## What is the biggest problem facing technology today?

Technology, while providing numerous benefits, also presents its own set of challenges. The biggest problem today, particularly for small businesses, is determining what technology to use to achieve business goals, how to implement it effectively, and managing its complexities. 

Let's dive deeper into this concept, exploring the nuances it carries for small scale retail and service industry businesses, and unravelling potential solutions that keep business unique yet efficient.

## The Challenge of Choice 

For small businesses, the sheer number of technology solutions available can be overwhelming. Automation tools, customer relationship management software, data tracking programs - the list is long, varied, and often confusing. Deciding which tools to adopt, and how to use them effectively, can be a daunting task. 

There isn't a single solution guaranteed to work for every business. The effectiveness of technology depends on the business type, industry, staff's technical capabilities, and many other factors. 

### Simplification is Key

 * Salesforce, when it comes to customer relationship management. 
 * HubSpot for marketing automation.
 * Trello for project management.
 * QuickBooks for accounting and payroll tasks. 

## The Implementation Conundrum

Even after choosing, implementing these technologies can be another complex hurdle. Businesses often have to balance new technology adoption alongside everyday tasks, which results in a steep learning curve and slowed productivity temporarily. 

Proper implementation also requires understanding the nuances and complexities of software or platforms. It's not just about using technology, but using it effectively to complement your business process.

### Time-Saving Tools are Dual-Edged Swords

 * Sprout Social for scheduling social media posts.
 * MailChimp for automating email newsletters.
 * Asana for managing daily business tasks. 
 * Buffer for simple and effective content scheduling.

## Customization vs Packaged Solution: Which delivers better?

More often than not, businesses lean towards packaged, 'all-in-one' solutions. But there's a valid argument to be made that a simpler, more custom solution can sometimes be more effective. Premade solutions might lack the unique touch a business requires, or end up being an overkill for a small team. 

Small businesses need to strike that perfect balance between customization and simplicity. It's all about understanding what your business genuinely needs.

## The Role of Perspective 

Third-party perspectives often play a critical role in delivering the most possible value, enabling businesses to save time and make educated decisions. The effectiveness of technology is not solely about the tools but how you use and adapt them according to your business needs. 

In this scenario, a consultant could be that much-needed outside perspective, offering quick and cost-efficient means to answer technology-related questions and match businesses with appropriate solutions. 

### Proven Consultant Driven Solutions 

 * Jira for agile project management handled by Atlassian consultants.
 * Zoho CRM managed by Zoho consultants for personalized CRM solutions.
 * Magento hosted by ecommerce consultants for tailored online retail solutions.
 * Shopify Plus coordinated by ecommerce consultants for growing businesses. 

## Wrapping up the narrative

It's crucial to remember that every business is unique and requires its solutions to reflect its individuality. Technology brings immense opportunities, but it also takes understanding, discipline, and thoughtful implementation to navigate the sea of complexities it presents. An outside perspective can prove invaluable in such situations, shining fresh light on the possibilities of technology integration while respecting and maintaining the individuality of the business. Now that's enough for today on this topic!

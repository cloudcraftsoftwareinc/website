## How to do SEO for beginners?

Search Engine Optimization, or SEO, is a key factor in improving your business's visibility in the digital landscape. As a nutshell answer, it's all about enhancing your website and its content to make it easier for search engines like Google to find and rank.

## Understanding SEO

First, let's establish what SEO is. It's a series of practices designed to help your website appear higher in search engine results. It draws on numerous factors, including the quality of your website's content, its loading speed, its accessibility on mobile devices, and its legitimacy (or lack thereof) in the eyes of search engine algorithms.

But don't be scared off by the jargon. SEO, in its essence, is about making your website as user-friendly and information-rich as possible.

## Importance of keywords

How does a search engine know what your website is about? Keywords. These are the terms or phrases that people type into Google (or another search engine) when they're looking. 

Examples might include " Italian restaurant in New York" or " iPhone repair in London". By identifying and using these keywords in your website content, you're telling search engines what your website offers and why it's a great match for those search queries.

### Some handy tools for keywords:

 * Google Keyword Planner
 * Ahrefs
 * Semrush
 * Moz Keyword Explorer

## SEO-friendly website design

Website design is more than just aesthetics. A well-designed website helps SEO by loading quickly, being easy to navigate and mobile-friendly. 

When search engines can't easily navigate your site, it's less likely to rank well. Ensuring your website is mobile-friendly is also essential, as the majority of searchers nowadays are using their mobile devices.

### Handy tools for website design: 

 * Wix
 * Wordpress
 * Weebly
 * Squarespace

## Content is King

You've probably heard the phrase "Content is King," and it's for a reason. Providing high-quality and relevant content on your site keeps visitors engaged and increases the chances someone will share it on social media, another important factor in SEO.

"Focus on creating content that helps your customers and sprinkles in the keywords where they naturally fit."

A blog is a great way to add fresh content regularly, which Google also loves. Just be sure it's well-written, valuable to your audience, and contains your keywords naturally and sparingly.

## Online Credibility

Building trust and credibility with your online audience is vital for high search engine ratings. One way to do this is through backlinks. Backlinks are links from other websites to your website, sort of like casting a vote of confidence.

But not all backlinks are created equal, getting backlinks from high-quality, reputable sites will do much more for your SEO than lots from low-quality sites.

### Handy tools for tracking backlinks: 

 * Ahrefs Backlink Checker
 * Majestic
 * SE Ranking
 * Moz Link Explorer

## Wrapping up

As we reach the end of our journey, it's clear that SEO is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It requires a holistic approach, combining technical aspects with quality content, credibility, and user experience. Remember, every business is unique and what works for one might not work for another. An outside opinion can help identify new opportunities for SEO improvement and bring the most value to your business. 

It may seem daunting at first, but with a clear understanding and a consistent approach, you can harness the power of SEO to drive more traffic to your site, resulting in more prospects, more sales, and ultimately, more growth for your business.

Search engine optimization, or SEO, is the practice of enhancing a website's visibility in search engine result pages (SERPs). For small businesses, a solid SEO strategy can make the difference between getting lost in the online crowd and standing out to potential customers.

More than just a buzzword, SEO is critical for your online visibility. It’s a simple and cost-effective way to reach local customers, increase your online presence, and grow your customer base.

### Key Aspects of SEO

 * Writing engaging, unique content

While SEO is essential, an impersonal, purely SEO-focused approach can leave your content reading like a robot. It’s important to remember that SEO is only part of the equation. Keep your content genuine and relatable.

To achieve the sweet spot between authenticity and SEO, ensure your content matches the interest, language, and needs of your target market. This strategy is not only effective in increasing your search engine ranking, but also engages and retains customers.

## Balancing User Experience

Writing SEO-optimized content doesn’t mean compromising on user experience. In fact, the two should go hand in hand. A good user experience can even enhance your SEO efforts. 

An intuitive layout, easy navigation, and engaging content all contribute to a positive user experience. This leads to longer site visits, reduced bounce rates, and ultimately, higher SERP rankings.

### User Experience Aspects to Consider

 * Site speed
 * Mobile responsiveness
 * Easy navigation
 * Readable and engaging content

## Wrapping Things Up

Remember, every small business is unique, and so must your SEO strategies be. Having an outside opinion can help identify opportunities of improvement that you might not have thought of. It’s about creating the most value, in the most efficient way, and more often than not, that requires a bit of assistance.

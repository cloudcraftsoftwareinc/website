## How will AI Improve Customer Service?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) stands poised to revolutionize customer service by automating routine tasks, enhancing customer interactions, and providing deep insights into customer behavior. The most significant improvements lie in its ability to offer high-quality, personalized solutions at scale, freeing up valuable time for small business owners to focus on enhancing their core offerings.

Our world is rapidly moving towards more interactive and responsive technologies. So how does this translate to an improvement in customer service for small businesses?

## Automation in Customer Service

Through automation, AI can handle repetitive and mundane tasks, leaving more room for your small team to address intricate and complex issues. Customer inquiries can be sorted and responded to quickly, enhancing efficiency and allowing for more timely customer responses.

Moreover, AI-powered chatbots provide immediate interaction, capable of solving basic queries or routing calls to the appropriate person, ensuring your small business offers stellar customer service around the clock.

### Some Examples

 * Zendesk provides AI customer support solutions, enabling businesses to handle large volumes of inquiries without needing more personnel.
 * Freshdesk uses AI to automate tasks like ticket assigning and detecting trends in issues among customers.
 * Zoho Desk brings context-aware AI to help desk software, helping businesses deliver better customer self-service and support agent productivity.
 * Bold360 by LogMeIn provides an AI-infused engagement platform that bridges the gap between artificial and human intelligence.

## Creating a Personalized Experience

AI can help streamline the process of providing personalized customer service using customer data. It can predict customer behavior, suggest individualized solutions, and allow for a more 'tailored' interaction - even for a small business.

AI also helps in proactive customer service, utilizing interaction data to anticipate customer needs. That way, de-escalation and issue resolution can begin before the customer feels the need to get in touch.

### Some Examples

 * Salesforce's AI tool, Einstein, helps businesses predict customer behavior and provide personalized experiences across all touchpoints.
 * Drift's AI chatbot helps businesses nurture leads and provide personalized offers using visitor's behaviour on the website.
 * Intercom's 'Operator’ uses AI to provide better customer segmentation and automated customer support.

## AI for Customer Insights

AI possesses the power to leverage customer data to offer deep behavioral insights. This information can be instrumental in developing customer service strategies, tailor-making offers, and predicting trends.

The analysis derived from AI tools allows small businesses to build better customer understandings, enabling them to deliver services that align with customer needs.

<blockquote> "Data is the new oil. It’s valuable, but if unrefined it cannot really be used." - Clive Humby </blockquote>

### Some Examples

  * Gong.io uses AI to analyze sales calls and meetings, providing insights on what practices close deals.
  * RapidMiner is an AI platform that provides predictive analytics to understand customer buying behaviors.
  * Pega provides businesses with an AI tool to help determine the next best action based on customer's past actions.
  
## Balancing AI and Human Touch

While AI holds immense potential, the value of a human touch in customer service can't be entirely replaced. AI tools can serve as valuable support, handling routine tasks while humans focus on heartfelt interactions and intricate problem-solving. It's about striking a balance where both humans and AI can work hand in hand to enhance customer experience.

### Some Examples

 * LivePerson provides AI chatbots but also maintains an option for human intervention when the conversation becomes complex.
 * Kustomer provides an AI platform that automates communications but allows for escalation to a human if necessary.
 * Dialpad uses VoiceAI for real-time call transcription and analytics, but still requires a human for complex interactions and decision making.

## Wrapping it Up

The use of AI in customer service can immensely bolster a small business. By handling routine tasks, offering personalized experiences and gaining customer insights, AI tools offer the possibility of scaling without skimping on quality. However, every business is unique, and understanding individual needs and circumstances is key to maximizing the benefits of AI. It's here that considering an external consultation can add immense value, by identifying specific tools and strategies that align with your distinct business needs and goals.

Let's take one step forward to this promising era.

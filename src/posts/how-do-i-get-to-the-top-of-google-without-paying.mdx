## Embrace SEO Strategy

SEO strategy is the heart of organic search performance. It incorporates several elements including keyword research, On-page SEO and Off-page SEO.

It's essential to understand and target the keywords your potential customers are likely using on their Google search. Tools like Google Keyword Planner, Moz and SEMrush can aid you in this undertaking.

### SEO Strategy Elements 

 * Keyword research and targeting
 * On-page SEO (includes website structure, meta tags, and content, among others)
 * Off-page SEO (Taking care of factors outside your website such as backlinks)

## Consistent High-Quality Content

Google algorithms appreciate, and as a result, promote fresh, valuable content. Consistently delivering quality content on your website and blog effectively tells Google that your site is alive and brimming with beneficial information for users.

When you provide valuable industry-specific content, it encourages other websites to link back to your website. Backlinks send positive signals to Google, boosting your SEO efforts.

### Examples of Quality Content

 * Educational blog posts
 * Engaging infographics
 * Helpful 'how-to' guides
 * Industry analysis and insights

## Google My Business Listing

This is one of the quickest and simplest ways to gain local visibility on Google. A well-optimized Google My Business (GMB) listing can place your business in Google's Local Pack, thus giving your business significant exposure.

The beauty of GMB is that it's free. Ensure you provide accurate information (Name, Address, Phone Number) plus relevant categories for your business. Frequent updates with photos and reviews can do wonders in enhancing your local SEO.

## Prioritize Mobile Optimization

With the increasing global mobile-usage uptrend, it's hard to ignore mobile optimization. Google picks up on websites with mobile-friendly designs, granting them improved mobile search rankings.

To get started, test your site's mobile-friendliness with Google's Mobile Friendly Test and make necessary improvements. Remember it's not only about squeezing your site to fit into a mobile screen but ensuring optimal user experience as well.

### Quick Mobile Optimization Tips

 * Ensure text is readable without zooming
 * Avoid software that's not common on mobile devices like Flash
 * Size content to fit the screen so users donâ€™t have to scroll horizontally or zoom
 * Place links far enough apart so that the correct one can be easily tapped

## Wrapping Up

Getting to the top of Google without paying is not just a pipe dream, but a plausible reality with consistent effort and dedication. It involves understanding Google's algorithm (which prioritizes user experience) and leveraging SEO strategies to make your online content valuable and visible.

Since every business is unique, it's essential to fine-tune your SEO strategy to suit your business. Getting an outside perspective could help generate novel insights and steer businesses on the correct path of organic search success.

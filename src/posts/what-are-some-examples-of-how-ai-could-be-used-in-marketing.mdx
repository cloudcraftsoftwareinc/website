## Examples of AI in Customer Segmentation

Small businesses can maximize marketing results by identifying distinct customer segments and personalizing messaging accordingly. AI assists in interpreting consumer data and uncovering behavioral patterns that a human analysis may not be as competent in.

Marketing automation tools such as HubSpot and Marketo provide AI-functions that can help in this segmentation process. However, these are not always a one-size-fits-all solution. Each business has varying needs and resources, warranting a customized approach to employing AI tools.

## Predictive Capabilities of AI

One of AI's forte is predictive analysis – providing actionable insights on customer behaviors and trends before those trends become mainstream. Solutions like Looker and ZohoAnalytics deliver these capabilities, yet it’s essential to determine real business needs effectively before diving into a tool recommendation.

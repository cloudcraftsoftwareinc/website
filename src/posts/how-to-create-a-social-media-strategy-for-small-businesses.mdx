## How to create a social media strategy for small businesses?

Small businesses often face unique challenges when it comes to managing their social media presence. The secret to overcoming these challenges lies in developing a well-thought-out social media strategy that matches your business's unique needs and goals. A good social media strategy considers factors such as your target audience, platform choice, content creation, and engagement metrics. Yet, understanding the nuts and bolts of each platform and accurately assessing your business needs can be daunting, and sometimes a simpler, custom solution can provide more value and save time.

Even small businesses can benefit from looking outside their operations for help with this. Firstly, let's get an overview of just what a social media strategy should cover and then delve into the details.

## Recognizing your target audience

Knowing your customer is the cornerstone of any successful business strategy, and social media is no different. Spend some time noting down who your ideal customer is - their age, interests, and the problem that your business solves for them.

In social media terms, different platforms attract different demographics. For instance, Instagram and TikTok are likely to be favored by younger customers, while LinkedIn is popular amongst professionals. A third-party consulting service can prove to be invaluable in helping you understand where your customers are likely to be found online.

### Platforms frequently used by different demographics:

 * Instagram - Younger audience, more visual content
 * TikTok - Younger audience, short, fun, and creative videos
 * LinkedIn - Professional and B2B, informative content
 * Facebook - Broad audience, mixed content types

## Types of content

Once you've determined where your audience is, the next step is to figure out what type of content resonates most with them. Posts could be informational, inspirational, promotional, or even conversational. Remember, your content should be a reflection of your brand's voice and values.

Again, industry trends can only take you so far. Engaging a consultant to tap into your specific audience's needs can help you craft more effective posts. This, in turn, could significantly increase engagement rates and conversion.

### Common types of successful content:

 * Informational or educational posts
 * Inspirational quotes or stories
 * Promotional offers or giveaways
 * Conversational or interactive posts

## Creating a consistent brand voice

Establishing a consistent brand voice and vision across all platforms helps increase your audience's recognition and trust in your brand. Your brand voice could be fun, professional, or inspiring depending on your business and audience.

<blockquote>"Your online presence, from visuals to voice, should echo your physical store or office space."</blockquote>

It's important to reiterate that there is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to social media strategy. A third-party consultation can help tailor your brand voice to match your business ethos and resonate with your unique audience.

## Measuring Performance

Remember, all these strategies are pointless if they don't result in measurable improvement. Platforms like Facebook and Instagram offer in-built analytics that give you an idea of how well your posts are doing. However, these should be complemented with personalized KPIs that match your business' goals.

### Examples of customized KPIs:

 * Number of new followers per week
 * Level of audience interaction (like, share, comment)
 * Clicks to your website or product
 * Conversions resulting from social media posts

## Wrapping the conversations up

In this ever-evolving digital landscape, creating a robust social media strategy is essential for small businesses. While third-party tools can provide some value, remember that often a simpler, custom solution can be more effective. Understanding your unique business needs can yield the most value and save time, and getting an outside opinion might just shine a light on new opportunities for improvement. 

Tailored solutions are waiting for you out there, and with a bit of support and guidance, you can create a social media strategy that not only connects with your audience but propels your small business to new heights. Until next time, keep exploring and experimenting!

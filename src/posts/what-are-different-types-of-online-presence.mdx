## What are different types of online presence?

Online presence refers to all the places on the internet where your business is represented or can be found. It includes your website, social media profiles, online directories, review sites, search engines and more.

Now more than ever, a strong online presence offers small businesses the opportunity to efficiently connect with their target customers. You’ve probably heard it said that if your business can't be found online, it's as if it doesn't exist. But how you approach your online presence can substantially affect how your business is perceived.

## Website: Your Business’s Home Base

Your website is the heart of your online presence. It’s the one place online where you have full control over your message. Here, you can tell your business story, showcase your products or services, and connect with customers directly through contact forms or live chat.

However, a well-designed website alone isn't enough. It needs to be backed up with strong search engine optimization (SEO) to increase visibility and ensure potential customers can find you easily.

### Quick Checklist for a Strong Website

 * Easy to navigate
 * Mobile-friendly
 * Secure (HTTPS enabled)
 * Clear messaging and calls to action
 * Up-to-date contact information

## Social Media Platforms: Engaging and Growing Your Customer Base

The power of social media in building an online presence can't be overlooked. Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter provide platforms for you to interact with customers, advertise services, and receive feedback.

Remember, quality over quantity applies here. Rather than stretching thin over multitude platforms, focus on the ones where your target audience hangs out most.

### Handys for Effective Social Media Presence 

 * Regular posting schedule
 * Involve in conversations
 * Share valuable content
 * Use of quality and relevant visuals
 * Maintain brand consistency

## Online Directories and Reviews: Boosting Visibility and Credibility 

Get your business listed on popular online directories and review sites like Google My Business, Yelp, Bing Places, and Trip Advisor. Not only do these help boost your SEO, they provide a platform for customers to leave reviews, increasing your business credibility.

Responding to both positive and negative reviews shows your commitment to customer satisfaction.

## Email Marketing: Keeping Your Audience Engaged 

"Email has an ability many channels don’t: creating valuable, personal touches– at scale." – David Newman. 

Email marketing is a fantastic way to keep your audience informed about your products, offers, and news. However, it requires careful planning, ensuring you're providing content of value rather than spamming your customers' inboxes.

Remember, personalization is key in successful email marketing campaigns.

## Blogging: Demonstrating Expertise and Building Authority 

Maintaining a blog on your website helps in demonstrating your expertise, increasing website traffic, and improving your SEO. 

Notably, blogging isn’t just about promoting your products or services, but crafting content that provides value to your audience and solves their pain points. It's important to maintain a regular posting schedule and focus on quality.

### Content Ideas for Your Business Blog

 * Guides and how-tos related to your industry
 * Case studies or customer success stories
 * Industry news and insights
 * Behind-the-scenes or team features

## Wrapping it up

The types of online presence mentioned above are key components but not the only ones. Ultimately, it's about choosing avenues that best fit your business, target audience, and goals. Remember, while digital tools and platforms are essential, the expressions of your brand’s values, mission and identity are what truly resonate with customers. Sometimes, it’s advantageous to have a third-party perspective to evaluate your business and recommend the most effective strategies customized to your needs.

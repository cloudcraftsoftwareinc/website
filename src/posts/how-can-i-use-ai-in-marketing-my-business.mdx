## How can I use AI in marketing my business?

Harnessing the power of AI can streamline your business's marketing efforts, saving time and offering insights that would be nearly impossible to manually process. They can help you focus more on creative areas, creating a unique selling proposition, rather than getting bogged down in administrative tasks.

We'll delve further into these AI options. But can one solution really fit all businesses? Would an off-the-shelf product work as efficiently as a tailored one?

## Exploring AI options

Artificial Intelligence offers a broad spectrum of capabilities that can be especially beneficial to small businesses. AI can improve efficiency, streamline workflows, and provide valuable insights into customer behavior.

Yet, it's essential to remember: while these tools can provide help, they don't necessarily understand your unique business. Let’s explore how AI tools can benefit your business marketing specifically.

### Areas where AI can make a difference

 * Chatbots for 24/7 customer interaction such as Drift or Friendly Chat
 * Social media automation tools like Buffer or Hootsuite
 * Predictive analysis tools for customer behavior, like Salesforce or Google Analytics
 * Content generation automation through tools like Phrasee or Reply

## Analyzing third-party tools

While a lot of these tools are plug-and-play, they often come as a one-size-fits-all approach.

Just because a tool is readily available doesn't necessarily mean it's going to add value to your business. It’s like using a sledgehammer to pound a finishing nail. You may be able to drive the nail home, but there’s probably a better tool for the job. 

## The value of a custom solution

Instead of jumping into the pool of readily available products, taking a step back and understanding your unique business needs can often lead to better results.

Developing a bespoke AI solution is not as daunting as it might seem. There’s often simple, cost-efficient solutions that fit your business minimizing any potential disruption.

### Some platforms to consider for building custom solutions

 * Algorithms enabled platforms such as Rapid Miner
 * Amazon Sagemaker for developers
 * Customized chatbot platforms like MobileMonkey or ManyChat
 * Natural Language Processing tools like Google Cloud Natural Language

## Honest reevaluation is key

<blockquote>Remember, it's essential not to set and forget. Regularly reevaluate – is the tool still serving the purpose you intended? Is there a simpler solution?</blockquote>

As your business grows and evolves, so too will your requirements. If an existing tool isn’t adding value, it may be time to explore other options or consult a third party for an outside perspective.

## Weighing the pros and cons

While it’s undoubtedly beneficial to leverage AI technologies, we can't underestimate the value of still having humans doing what they do best - understanding and communicating your unique selling proposition.

You are the best person to understand your business, but sometimes an outside perspective can help you identify new areas for improvement.

### Best practices for implementing AI in Marketing

 * Identifying the areas where automation can be beneficial
 * Assessing the need for third-party tools vs. custom solutions
 * Regularly reevaluating the usefulness of the tools you are using
 * Consulting an outside perspective before switching to a major solution

## Wrapping it up for now

The beauty and challenges of running a smaller business are that every operation has its unique touch. Emphasizing this singularity and deploying the right mix of automated and human-operated tasks could be your key to success, and having an outside perspective can help navigate this more efficiently. The right employee, consultant, or tool can bring out the best in any business. But for today, that’s enough food for thought!

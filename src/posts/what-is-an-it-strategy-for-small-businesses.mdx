## What is an IT strategy for small businesses?

In the simplest terms, an IT strategy for small businesses is an integral part of the overall business strategy, envisioning how technology can work alongside the business to fulfil its aims and objectives. However, there's much more to it than just getting your hands on the latest tech trends - a savvy IT strategy is about utilizing technology to solve business problems, boost productivity and deliver superior customer experiences.

Just because your business may be small, don't assume that IT strategy is merely a luxury; it's absolutely essential in today's digital era where even the smallest of businesses can compete with the big guns, thanks to technology.

## Why do small businesses need an IT strategy?

A properly planned and executed IT strategy ensures that all your IT resources are pulling together in the same direction. It's absolutely vital for optimising your resources, keeping costs down, and boosting your efficiency in the fiercely competitive market. 

Remember, you don't necessarily need the biggest IT arsenals to keep up with the corporate giants - just the right tools in your toolbox will do. And that's what a bulletproof IT strategy brings to your small business table.

### Here are some ways a robust IT strategy can make a difference for your small business:

 * Enhancing productivity through automation tools like Zapier or Automate.io.
 * Streamlining operations with project management tools such as Asana or Trello.
 * Mitigating risks with cybersecurity tools like Norton or Avast.
 * Gaining insights and improving decision making with analytics tools like Google Analytics or Hubspot's analytics tools.

## The IT Strategy Stitch-in-Time: Save Nine

Delaying or relegating IT strategy can lead to needless expenditure, inefficiency and even business disasters down the road. It's similar to paying for patching up a leaky roof time and again, instead of fixing it once and for all.

On the other hand, getting a grip on IT strategy early on can help you avoid these pitfalls and place you on the road to continuous improvement and business growth. 

## Embracing Technology With Open Arms: But How?

Very often, small businesses get overwhelmed by the endless array of technologies and tools out there. That's where a tech-savvy guide or a consultant can be an enormous help. They can help you navigate through the labyrinth of tech choices and find the most effective tools to meet your unique business needs.

### Think of these consultants as your compass:

 * Identifying gaps and proposing tech solutions with tools like Microsoft Workplace Analytics.
 * Guiding you through new tech like Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Learning (ML) powered tools.
 * Helping you choose the right software from complex choices like CRM or ERP systems.
 * Assisting you to step up your customer engagement game with suitable marketing automation tools.

## Keep Calm and Tread The Tech Waters

<blockquote> "The technology you use impresses no one. The experience you create with it is everything." - Sean Gerety </blockquote>

Don't let tech jargon and trends intimidate you. Remember, technology serves as a means to an end, and not an end in itself. Implement technology to enhance the user experience, optimize your processes and ultimately to serve your customers better.

Fancy tech that doesn't serve your purpose or align with your business goals is as good as a hammer to a patient in a hospital - completely irrelevant and possibly damaging! 

## The Road Towards Tech-Savvy Business

Your journey to becoming a tech-savvy small business doesn't need to be complicated or expensive. It's not about having the priciest tech or jumping on every single tech bandwagon that comes by. It's more about understanding your businesses, knowing your pain points, and finding the right tech tools that align with your goals.

### Always remember:

 * There is a myriad of affordable and efficient tech tools out there, tailor-made for small businesses.
 * It's not 'one size fits all'. Every business is unique; it requires a bespoke approach.
 * An outside perspective can identify new opportunities and potential improvements.
 * Consultants can answer technology queries quickly - it's cost-efficient and tailored to your needs.

## Creating Your Unique IT Strategy

To wrap things up, a well-thought-out IT strategy is not just desirable, it's absolutely necessary for small businesses in today's digital era. Nurturing a balanced relationship between business and technology can deliver phenomenal results. And remember, every business is unique. Custom solutions, rather than an off-the-shelf package, can often be more effective. An outside perspective can help you spot your business's individual needs to deliver optimum value, save time and take your small business to new heights.

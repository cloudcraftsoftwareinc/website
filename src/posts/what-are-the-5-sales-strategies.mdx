## Establishing a Unique Selling Proposition

Creating a unique selling proposition (USP) helps distinguish your business from competitors. It's about finding that special something that makes your product or service stand out.

What can you do that others can’t? What makes your business unique? These are questions that come into play while developing your USP. Discovering this defining element could be your first step towards a successful sales strategy.

### Notable Examples of Unique Selling Propositions

 * Domino's Pizza promising "You get fresh, hot pizza delivered to your door in 30 minutes or less—or it's free."
 * Avis ("We're number two. We try harder.")
 * M&Ms ("The milk chocolate melts in your mouth, not in your hand.") 

## Understanding your Customer

Knowing your customer isn’t just about demographics. It's about understanding their needs, preferences, and the value they get by engaging with your business.

By understanding your customer's journey, you can create personalized experiences that take them from just interested to loyal fans. It’s about facilitating an experience that speaks their language and satisfies their unique needs.

## Redefining the Customer Experience

Perhaps one of the most undervalued strategies is enhancing the customer experience. It's not just about the product or service, but the journey through which customers interact with your business.

It’s these experiences that form a part of their memories and dictates whether they come back to you or go to your competitors. Remember, a happy customer is your best advocate.

### Examples of exceptional customer experiences

 * Zappos is renowned for its customer service. There's a story that a customer once received flowers from Zappos after they found out her mom had died.
 * Remember the backlash United Airlines faced after their horrifying customer service incident? Customer experiences can make or break businesses.

## Utilizing Social Selling

Social selling is gaining grounds, and it's worth exploring. It's about leveraging your social network to find the right prospects, build trusted relationships, and achieve your sales goals.

In a world where people spend a significant chunk of their day on social media, tapping into this method could significantly boost your small business sales.

### Facts about Social Selling

 * 78% of salespeople engaged in social selling are outperforming their peers (source: LinkedIn).
 * Businesses that utilize social selling see a 16% win rate and 2x pipeline (source: Sales for Life).

## Leveraging Referral Sales

Referrals are potent sales strategies for small businesses. They are grounded in trust, and trust breeds credibility. Think about it: wouldn’t you be more willing to try out a service your friend can’t stop gushing about?

Referrals help reduce sales efforts by driving high-quality leads to your business. It's about turning your satisfied customers into your brand advocates.

### The Power of Referrals

 * Acquiring a new customer is between five and 25 times more expensive than retaining an existing one (source: Harvard Business Review).

That's all for today! Remember, no two businesses are alike—each has its quirks and individualities. Whether you're harnessing the power of social selling or meticulously carving your unique selling proposition, wisdom lies in understanding your business' unique needs and adapting accordingly. Having an expert perspective can reveal opportunities you might not see and bring added value, saving you time and resources in your quest for success. Happy selling!

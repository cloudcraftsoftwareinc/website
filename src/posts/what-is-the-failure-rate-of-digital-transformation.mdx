## What is the failure rate of digital transformation?

Contrary to the popular belief, achieving success in digital transformation is not a cake walk. For small businesses, studies suggest a failure rate between 60% to 80%. The causes contributing to such high failure rates vary from lack of strategic planning, improper technology adaptation to resistance to change.

The promise of digital transformation —efficiency, improved customer experience, and enhanced competitiveness — can often come with steep learning curves and unexpected challenges.

## Why is the failure rate so high?

Much of the failure can be attributed to the misconception that digital transformation is merely about adopting new technologies. In reality, it's about preparing your organization - and your small alliances - to adopt new ways of working that capitalize on the opportunities these technologies offer. 

Another critical failure point is the lack of understanding about customer needs. Simply digitizing an existing business process without anticipating the need for change or innovations can lead to missed opportunities and, ultimately, failure.

### Common Misunderstandings

 * Believing that technology alone can drive transformation.
 * Misalignment between business and digital strategies.
 * Underestimating the scale and scope of the transformation.
 * Ignoring the importance of the role of culture in successful implementation.

## Are big companies more successful?

Interestingly, the size of the company doesn't guarantee success. While larger companies may have more resources to allocate towards digital efforts, they may struggle with bureaucracy and long-established traditions that can slow down the overall progress. On the other hand, smaller firms struggle with lack of resources, particularly skilled manpower and financial resources.

## Can digital transformation be less risky?

"The best way to minimize risk is to move slowly and intentionally, with clear objectives and benefits in mind."

Yes, it can be. The key is to approach it strategically. Rather than chasing after the newest tech trends, small businesses should focus on their unique needs and how digital tools can best meet them.

## What are the main factors for a successful digital transformation?

Truly successful digital transformation is characterized by a blend of strategy, flexibility, customer-centricity and change management. It involves a deep understanding of how technology can drive business processes and outcomes and comes complete with a strategic, adaptable roadmap that is decidedly customer-focused.

### Crucial elements for Success

 * A clear digital strategy linked to business goals.
 * A flexible approach capable of adapting to changes in technology and market conditions.
 * A focus on enhancing customer experience.
 * Internal change management processes to ensure the entire organization is onboard with the transformation.

## Wrapping up on the Digital Transformation Journey 

Every small business is unique, requiring a tailored approach when it comes to digital transformation. The success lies often in careful planning, a clear vision and the disciplined execution of the strategy. An outside perspective can be instrumental in identifying new opportunities and potential roadblocks, saving both time and resources. Considering engaging a consultant to take advantage of their objectivity and expert understanding of digital trends and their applicability to your business situation.

## Will AI replace bookkeepers?

AI is not poised to replace bookkeepers in small businesses, but rather to change the nature of their work. While AI can automate certain processes, there is still a definite need for human touch in managing finances.

It's a natural question for small business owners to ponder, particularly those in the retail and service industries. After all, advances in AI and automation are transforming industries left and right. Will bookkeepers be next?

## Embracing the AI shift

Just like calculators did not replace accountants, AI is not wiping out the profession of bookkeepers. Instead, AI tools are becoming a bookkeeper's best ally. They handle mundane tasks, which frees up bookkeepers to focus on more strategic areas.

With AI taking over data entry, reconciliation, and basic calculations, bookkeepers have more time for advising on cost-cutting measures, cash flow improvements, or investment opportunities – tasks requiring human insight and judgement.

### Some tools in the field

 * Pabbly: Handles subscription billing automation
 * Sage 50cloud: Comprehensive solution with integrated AI assistant

## Shifting towards advisory roles

As AI tools handle the grunt work, bookkeepers evolve into business advisors. They are well-positioned to interpret data that AI extracts and spot trends or issues that might not be noticeable to an algorithm. It marries tech and human touch beautifully.

With this shift, bookkeepers are becoming more valuable to small businesses. They go beyond keeping books balanced - they turn into significant players in strategic decision-making, shaping the trajectory of businesses.

## Fostering interaction over automation

<blockquote tip>“With AI, it’s not about replacing human interaction, but supporting it.”</blockquote>

While AI has proven invaluable for small businesses, it's essential to maintain the human touch. Customers should not feel that they are interacting with a robot, but that the AI is there to assist them in their interactions with the organization.

The goal is to blend AI and human customer service smoothly, ensuring that your business maintains its unique charm while benefiting from the ease AI has to offer.

## Why consultation matters 

Although it's tempting to go for the most advertised, “all-in-one” AI solutions, they might not be the best choice for every business. Each business is unique and so should their approach to implementing AI solutions.

A consultant who can understand your business needs and make the most fitting recommendations would be a beneficial investment.

### Handy tools that a consultant might recommend 

 * Drift: A conversational marketing platform that connects businesses with their customers.
 * Einstein: Salesforce's AI program that interprets data to give businesses insights.
 * Freshdesk: A customer service software that enables businesses to streamline their customer conversations in one place.
 * RapidMiner: A data science platform that provides an integrated environment for data preparation, machine learning, deep learning, and predictive model deployment.

## Wrapping it all up

With a clear understanding of your business, consultants can provide invaluable insights into using AI to improve your customer service. Every small business has a unique touch, something that makes it stand out. Choosing AI tools that align with your business's ethos and can wrap themselves around your needs — instead of pushing you into a one-size-fits-all frame — can truly take your customer experience to the next level.

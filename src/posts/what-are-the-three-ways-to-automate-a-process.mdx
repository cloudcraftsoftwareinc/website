## What are the three ways to automate a process?
Automation—precisely, business process automation—is a logical and capable assistant that allows small business owners to engage more efficiently with the core areas of their company. In this article, we will explore three ways to automate a process: Using automation software, outsourcing to a virtual assistant, and custom scripting.

Soften the worry lines, grab your favourite drink and delve further with us into these three methods that could reshape your business operations.

## Use Automation Software

Automation software like Zapier, Automate.io, and Klaviyo offers a simplified solution to business owners who want focused-in on business growth and creativity while the system takes care of repetitive tasks. Not only do they save time, but these third-party tools also reduce the chances of human errors.

Remember though, while these are fantastic solutions for many, they may not always be able to tailor-fit your unique needs. Investing in an outside consultant can often lead to a more customized solution that works specifically for your individual business.

### Automation Software Summary

* Zapier - Ideal for integrating different systems.
* Automate.io - Perfect for creating simple, automated workflows.
* Klaviyo - Great solution for email marketing tasks.
* Jira - A collaborative tool for project management.

## Hire a Virtual Assistant

Think of it as having an additional set of competent hands. A virtual assistant might be an excellent option if you'd prefer to have a human touch to your tasks. Platforms like Upwork and Fiverr enable you to find capable assistants based on the requirements of your tasks. 

But hiring a virtual assistant implies an ongoing expense. Thus, it's crucial to weigh the costs versus the benefits in your particular scenario.

### Virtual Assistant Platforms

* Upwork - Freelance marketplace with a variety of skilled professionals.
* Fiverr - Perfect for small, specific tasks.
* Freelancer - Large pool of freelance talent, suitable for various tasks.

## Implement Custom Scripting

Custom scripting (or programming) gives your business the advantage of having technology working exactly the way you need it to. Tools like Python and Ruby offer powerful automation capabilities, but they do require a certain level of technical knowledge—or the hiring of someone who has it.

However, the advantage here could be enormous. Custom scripting allows you to fine-tune every aspect of the process to your unique business needs. And, again, this is where considering the help of a consultant could be valuable.

### Custom Scripting Tools

* Python - Offers an accessible entry-point into programming automation.
* Ruby - Another easy-to-learn language with extensive capabilities.
* Javascript - A robust language popular for web automation tasks.

That said, it's crucial to strike a balance between automation and personalization. Nobody likes feeling like they're just another name on the mailing list.

## Automated Social Media Posts

Curating a strong social media presence is key to your business's success, however, constant updating can be tedious. Social media automation tools like Buffer or Hootsuite allow you to schedule posts in advance, saving you time and maintaining your online presence.

Remember, while automation can streamline your operations, the human touch should not be entirely eliminated. Plan some spontaneous posts as well to keep your content fresh and engaging.

### Preferred Social Media Automation Tools

 * Hootsuite
 * Later
 * SocialPilot 

## Cloud-Based Accounting Systems

Keeping your finances in check is fundamental for a thriving business. Cloud-based accounting systems like QuickBooks or FreshBooks not only automate your business finances but also provide easy access to account balances, outstanding invoices, and overall financial health.

However, remember that "a tool is only as good as its user". Be sure to understand how these systems work or hire a professional to make the most out of them.

## Wrapping up our discussion

<blockquote>“Technology, like a boat, is only as good as the captain steering it.” </blockquote>

Automation can revolutionize your business operations and catalyze growth. But remember, every business is unique and only you truly understand your business's needs. Getting an external viewpoint from a consultant or expert can prove invaluable in finding the most suitable, easy-to-use tools for your business, saving you time and resources in the long run.

To wrap things up, while these tools could be valuable additions to your operations, they're not substitutes for clear business strategies or the unique touch and personal approach that only you can provide. Always be open to exploring various options till you find what matches your business's unique needs and circumstances.

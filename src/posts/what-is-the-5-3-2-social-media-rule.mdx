## What is the 5 3 2 social media rule?

As a small business owner, managing your social media can feel overwhelming. But there is a simple content rule you can follow - the 5-3-2 rule. For every ten social media posts, this rule suggests: five should be content from others that is relevant to your audience, three should be content from you that is relevant and useful to your audience, and two should be something personal to humanize your brand. 

However, does this age-old rule still hold relevance in the fast-paced social media landscape of today? Let’s dive deeper.

## The Origin of the 5-3-2 Rule 

The 5-3-2 rule was introduced by TA McCann from Gist, aiming to maintain diverse and engaging content. It's a ratio that promotes a balance between self-promotion, adding value, and building personal connection with your audience.

The beauty of this rule lies in its simplicity, making it easy to apply for small businesses that may not have dedicated social media teams.

### Some social management tools you can use:

 * Buffer
 * Hootsuite
 * Sprout Social
 * Zoho Social

## The Benefits of the 5-3-2 Rule

Implementing this rule can offer several benefits. It ensures a variety of content, reducing the risk of your audience growing bored or disengaged. This mix of posts can also help humanize your brand, building stronger connections with your community.

However, remember that this rule is a guideline, not a hard-and-fast rule. It should be adapted to your unique business and audience needs.

### Consider these content creation tools:

## Critiques of the 5-3-2 Rule

<blockquote>Isn't your own content the best representation of your brand?</blockquote>

Some critique the 5-3-2 rule for focusing too much on external content. This approach can dilute your brand’s message or make your social media platforms feel less authentic. 

Adjusting the ratio to better fit your brand and audience could be more beneficial. Consultation with a third party can provide valuable perspective in understanding what mix works best for you.

## Conclusion

Applying the 5-3-2 rule could simplify your social media strategy, but always remember that what works best will depend on your unique business and audience. A wise approach would involve adapting and experimenting with different content ratios. 

Remembering to wrap things up, there's no one-size-fits-all solution. An outside opinion can help you identify new opportunities for improvement and craft a more customized strategy.

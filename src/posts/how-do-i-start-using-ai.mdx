## How do I start using AI?

Starting with AI doesn't need to be complex. Essentially, for a small business owner, it begins with identifying routine tasks that consume valuable time and can be automated. Think in terms of customer communication, appointment scheduling, and market analysis. Then trail AI solutions that best match these tasks.

It's always a good plan to take a broad view and consider the variety of AI applications available. But keep in mind, the perfect tool for your business is dependent on your unique needs and objectives.

## Why Consider AI?

AI can significantly improve efficiency in your business. It can take over repetitive, time-consuming tasks, freeing you to focus on more strategic aspects of your business. It can also learn from interactions to provide personalized customer experiences, something integral in the current service industry.

Moreover, introducing AI into your operations can help you uncover hidden patterns in your data, making decision-making a more informed process.

### Examples of AI benefits:

 * Streamlined operations (e.g., the use of AI chatbots for customer service)
 * Reduced labor costs
 * Improved decision-making (for instance, through data analysis tools like Sisense)
 * Greater personalization leading to enhanced customer experience

## Choosing an AI Solution

The scope of AI solutions in the market is vast, and choosing the right one relies on understanding your business's specific needs. Tools like Salesforce's Einstein AI or IBM's Watson cater to different aspects such as customer relationship management and data analysis, respectively, so reasonable analysis is crucial.

Understanding the volume of data you work with is also necessary since different AI platforms have varying abilities to handle data sizes. 

### AI tools to explore:

 * Salesforce's Einstein AI
 * IBM's Watson
 * Dialogflow for developing conversational interfaces
 * Automation Anywhere for business process automation

## Balancing Automation and Human Touch

<blockquote> "It's not about replacing human interaction, but enhancing it."</blockquote>

Incorporating AI doesn't mean ousting the human element. Your aim should be to strike a balance between automation and the personal touch your business is known for. After all, AI is there to augment human abilities and not replace them.

AI, backed by data, can give you insights into customer behavior and preferences, which you can use to create highly tailored experiences that your customers will appreciate.

## Roles of a Consultant

Consultants play a crucial role in assessing your business needs and recommending suitable AI solutions. They provide an outside perspective that can help identify opportunities to improve. While packaged solutions look appealing due to their ease of use, a custom solution based on a thorough understanding of your business often delivers more value.

A frank conversation with a technology consultant can save time and provide an efficient way for you to learn and understand what AI tools could be pivotal to your business.

### Benefits of engaging consultants:

 * Save time and resources
 * Get a custom-fit AI solution recommendation
 * Gain access to expert knowledge
 * Obtain an outside perspective on your business's operations

## Wrapping it all up

AI adoption is not a one-size-fits-all strategy. Each small business is unique, and therefore it’s vital to understand individual needs and goals. Leveraging an outsider's viewpoint, such as that of a consultant, can reveal new opportunities and save valuable time. After all, your business deserves a “shampoo” formulated specifically for it – not just an off-the-shelf solution.

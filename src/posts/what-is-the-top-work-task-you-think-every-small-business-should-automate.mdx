## What is the Top Work Task Every Small Business Should Automate?

Automating administrative tasks is often the best first step for small businesses seeking more efficiency. It frees up a significant amount of time usually spent on routine, manual tasks that can be better invested in areas requiring personal touch or strategic thinking.

Diving deeper, it raises the question, what administrative tasks can and should be automated first? And how can sensible automation drive progress instead of impersonal automation taking over?

## Understanding Utility and Pain Points 

To explore this question, we first need to understand the nature of work conducted in small businesses. It's about assessing where the most time is spent and evaluating the necessity and complexity of these tasks.

More often than not, it isn't the direct profit-generating activities that eat away at time but routine tasks supplementing the core business process - administrative errands that can and should be automated.

### Overarching Problematic Areas

 * Scheduling and confirming appointments
 * Processing online orders
 * Keeping up with social media updates
 * Sending recurring invoices

## Automation Tools: The Usual Culprits

This doesn't mean these tasks lose their value. Automation tools are available to take care of these tasks effectively while maintaining the essential human touch. Tools such as Calendly, Shopify, HootSuite, and QuickBooks are few among many tools that cater to these needs.

However, an unseen issue often crops up - the overwhelming number of options, each tool claiming to be an "all-in-one solution" meets every possible need. This can cause hesitancy, leading many small businesses to stick with "what they know" instead of venturing into unfamiliar territory.

## The Custom Approach: Simplicity is Key

However, choosing the right tool is paramount. In unlocking the value of automation, it's not about resorting to one-size-fits-all solutions but finding tools that fit your unique business needs. Often, simpler, custom solutions can be more effective than complex ones. 

### To Consider Before Automating

 * Prioritize tasks—identify the task that consumes the most time and provides the least value.
 * Test Before Implement—Experiment with different tools and observe their impact.
 * Assess your needs—Catch-all tools can be alluring but identify what you need, don't over-complicate things.
 * Don't lose touch—Ensure the tools selected help automate yet retain the human touch.

## Proceedings with Automation: A Tested Perspective

<blockquote>Automation can accelerate your business, but discernment is critical.</blockquote>

Keeping this in mind, we can see that although automation tools are aplenty, there is a need for a more nuanced approach to selection and implementation. Part of the task's problem is also the solution: what tasks are being done ad-hoc that could be scheduled, what tasks are recurring and how can they be automated, what business needs are being met with these tasks?

## Final Thoughts

Upon concluding, it's a reminder that every business is unique—its ethos, its pulse, its needs. In the hustle of the digital world, it’s helpful to remember that business-specific tasks require an equally unique touch. Injecting simplicity into automation can help small business owners to liberate their time from the routine and direct it towards substance. But wariness must accompany these steps into automation.

### Gaining Understanding

 * Businesses are unique entities needing unique automation.
 * An external viewpoint (consultant) can help discern what is necessary.
 * Simplicity should be a key ingredient in deciding automation tools.
 * Automation doesn’t imply loss of character—retain the human touch.

That’s all for today's dive into automation for small businesses! Whenever in doubt, it’s always worth revisiting this principle: simplicity trumps complexity, all the while ensuring the 'human' in your business shines through.

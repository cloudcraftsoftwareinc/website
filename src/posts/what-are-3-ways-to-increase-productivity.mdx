## What are 3 ways to Increase Productivity?

Increasing productivity for small businesses often boils down to three central tactics: delegating tasks effectively, utilizing technology, and streamlining processes. These strategies will form the crux of our discussion in this article.

Time is a commodity that every business owner needs in abundance. It's important to know where your time is best spent and how to free up more of it to focus on core business activities.

## Delegate Tasks Effectively

Knowing when and what to delegate can be a game-changer. The key is to identify routine tasks which are necessary but don't necessarily contribute to your business's growth. 

You may worry about a task not being done exactly as you'd do it, but remember that "perfect" is often the enemy of "productive”. Taking a step back and trusting your team can provide them with the opportunity for growth and result in an overall increase in productivity.

### Effective Delegation Tactics

 * Utilize team members' strengths
 * Provide clear instructions and expectations
 * Give feedback and appreciate efforts
 * Empower and trust your team 
 
## Utilize Technology

Embracing automation can streamline your workflow and reduce costs. Technology can help even small businesses improve productivity by automating repetitive tasks.

Selecting the right applications or services requires a careful evaluation of your business's needs. Packaged solutions like Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace may seem enticing, but it's often more cost-effective to work with a consultant who can provide a customized solution for your unique needs.

### Recommended Tools for Automation

 * Trello for project management
 * Asana for task and workflow automation
 * Quick Books for accounting
 * Google Workspace for collaboration

## Streamline Processes

Amid the chaos of running a small business, processes can become convoluted. Take the time to streamline operations. While it might seem time-consuming in the short run, it will save time and money in the long run.

Remember, simple is often better. Having a consultant review your existing processes can provide an outside perspective, helping you identify inefficiencies and areas for improvement.

###s for Streamlining Processes

 * Conduct regular process audits
 * Implement standardized procedures
 * Eliminate unnecessary steps
 * Leverage technology for efficiency

"To increase productivity, don't just work harder. Work smarter."

Streamlining is all about optimizing the way things are done. It's not about cutting corners, but rather recognizing and removing unnecessary roadblocks.

## Wrapping Up 

Productivity in small business isn't about cramming more tasks into fewer hours. It's about ensuring each action brings you closer to your goals. Every business is unique, and there’s no one-size-fits-all productivity solution. Having an independent evaluation of your business can uncover opportunities, helping you work smarter, not just harder. As they say, success is a journey, not a destination. Keep exploring, keep refining, and most importantly, keep learning. And that's a wrap for today!

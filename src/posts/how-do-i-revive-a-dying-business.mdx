## Identify underlying issues

First off, you need to get to the root of why your business is struggling. This might be market shifts, lack of customer engagement, outdated business models, or operational inefficiencies.

By making an honest, critical assessment of your business, you can reveal the foundational problems that need addressing.

### Key Issues that could be plaguing your business:

 * Shifting market dynamics
 * Decreased customer engagement
 * Outdated business models
 * Operational inefficiencies
 
## Reassess Your Business Model

Next, take a hard look at your business model. Consider whether it aligns with the current demands and trends of the market. If not, it might be time for a pivot. Don't fear to make sweeping changes if necessary.

Being adaptable will help your business stay relevant and competitive.

### Possible Changes to Your Business Model:

 * Shifting focus to high-demand products/services

## Embrace Technology and Automation

"Technology is a friend of the savy business owner", as the saying goes.  Tools like Trello for task management, MMGuardian for parenting, or Caesium - a handy image compressor, can streamline operations and deliver a better customer experience.

Choosing custom solutions could also be more effective and essentially simpler than all-in-one packages. Evaluate the needs of your business and invest accordingly.

### Some Helpful Tech Tools to Consider:

 * Trello for task management
 * MMGuardian for parenting screens
 * Caesium for image compression
 * Zapier for automating tasks
 
## Invest in Marketing and Customer Engagement

Your customers need to feel valued and engaged. Reinvest time and resources into marketing and customer engagement. Social media channels, email newsletters, and discounts can be effective ways to reconnect with your customer base.

Remember, customers make a business. Without them, no business can thrive.

### A Few Customer Engagement Strategies:

 * Social media campaigns
 * Email newsletters
 * Customer loyalty programs
 * Hosting webinars or online events
 
## To Wrap Things Up

Reviving a struggling business isn't easy. It requires strategic changes, a customer-centered approach, and the willingness to embrace technology. Remember, every business is unique, with distinctive solutions. An outside opinion could provide fresh insight into unexplored ways for improvement. Hang in there, and remember: It's not about how many times you fall, but how many times you get back up.

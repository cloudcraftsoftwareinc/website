## How does AI speed up the pace of doing business?

AI accelerates the speed of doing business by automating and optimizing routine tasks, freeing up valuable time for small business owners, which can then be used on fostering creativity and building customer relationships. 

But is it as simple as just implementing XYZ AI product and voilà, instant results? As we will see, the answer may not be as straightforward as it appears on the surface.

## Choosing the right AI tool

While there is no shortage of AI tools in the market boasting of comprehensive 'all-in-one' promises, the real question is: are they truly the best fit for every small business? Adobe's AI platform Sensei and Salesforce's Einstein are great solutions but might be more than what's needed for a business with less than ten employees. 

'mature' AI applications like Alexa for Customer service or Newton Mail for email management serve specific needs and may offer a more cost-effective starting point.

## Importance of adopting a simple, custom AI solution

Simplicity can often trump complexity – a philosophy that mirrors the unique challenges and opportunities of small businesses. A simpler, custom solution, tailored to the specific needs of a small business, can be more effective than an expensive, feature-heavy software. Tools like Kore.ai for simple chatbots or Aivo for AI customer support might offer a more straightforward solution.

To make the best technology decisions, an outside perspective is invaluable. Blending this with the owner's deep understanding of their business can bring about the most efficient solution.

## DIY vs getting some help

<blockquote> "Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.” – Helen Keller </blockquote>

Whilst it is possible to do everything alone, time is a precious resource for solo/small business operators. Engaging a consultant can be a quick and cost-efficient way of answering technology questions quickly and matching with the appropriate solution.

## Weighing the benefits and pitfalls

Not all too shiny AI tools are without their pitfalls. A poor or rushed choice can lead to inefficiencies and expensive workarounds. CleverTap, HubSpot, or MailChimp might be widely popular, but if they are an ill-fit for your business, they could cause more problems than they solve.

Remember, every business is unique and requires a unique solution. Engaging a trusted third party for an outside opinion can help identify new opportunities for improvement and mitigate risk.

## On a final note

To wrap things up, AI can undoubtedly catalyze the pace of doing business for small companies with a keen choice of tools. But, keep in mind that simplicity often beats complexity, and an outside perspective could make all the difference. Here's to thoughtful use of AI and the growth and success of your small business!

## Can You Legally Write a Book with AI?

Yes, legally, you can write a book with AI. The more pertinent issue, however, is whether the resultant book can be copyrighted, or whether it bears any legal standing in the first place. The subject itself raises more questions surrounding the creativity, individuality, and intellectual property laws, which we'll delve into as we go on.

## The Legal Stance

When it comes to legal texts and legislation, they are usually straightforward, but AI complicates this a bit. In some jurisdictions, for a work to be copyrightable, it requires original creative contribution, which questions whether an AI-generated work can be considered 'original' or 'creative'.

AI, unlike humans, doesn't create out of thin air. It processes and generates content based on the data it has been fed. This puts the creativity side of the equation under scrutiny. 

### Legal Implications 

 * Copyright laws vary globally, and the grey area of AI-generated works is still under discussion.
 * Some jurisdictions like the U.S. specify that for a work to be copyrightable, it must be created by a human being.
 * Questions of who owns the right to the work - the AI developer or the person who input the data into the AI â€“ are still open-ended. 
 * There's also the issue of plagiarism if the AI reuses content from its training data. 

## The Technology Behind AI Writing 

AI makes use of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to understand, analyze, and generate human-like text. There's a wide range of AI-powered software such as OpenAI's GPT-3, Google's BERT, and many others that can generate coherent and contextually relevant text that could be used for book writing. 

That said, the success and fluidity of such a venture is also dependent on the quality and diversity of the input data. 

### A Snapshot of AI Writing Tools 

 * OpenAI's GPT-3: This AI model is capable of writing poetry, generating code, and even writing an entire article.
 * Google's BERT: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) allows developers to train their question-answering models. 
 * TalkToTransformer: This online tool uses OpenAI's GPT-2 model to write coherent paragraphs of text.

## Harnessing AI for Business Writing

<blockquote>If harnessed correctly, AI can be a business's writer extraordinaire.</blockquote>

AI writing doesn't necessarily spell doom for creativity but rather, it opens new avenues for businesses to streamline content creation. AI can generate business reports, marketing copy, social media posts, and even newsletters, saving business owners valuable time and help them focus on what they do best. 

That said, while AI can handle routine writing tasks, it may not fully replace a human touch just yet. Each business is unique, and a word weaved by a thoughtful human mind resonates more deeply than a machine-generated paragraph. 

## Balancing Custom Solution and Third-Party Tools 

Sure, tools like GPT-3 and BERT can automate a lot of written content. Yet, nothing beats a tailor-made solution for your business. Sometimes a simpler, custom solution can provide more value than a packaged "all-in-one" tool. 

Besides, having an external pair of eyes evaluating your business needs can help you navigate the labyrinth of technology more efficiently. It not only saves time but potentially guides you towards a solution perfectly matching your business needs. 

### The Benefits of Both Sides

 * Cheap and efficient, AI tools can take on the routine writing tasks, freeing up time for strategic work. 
 * Custom solutions provide the much-needed personal touch that a business needs to resonate with its target audience.
 * Third-party tools are great for general tasks, yet they may not be precisely fit for more niche requirements. 
 * Consulting with a knowledgeable outsider can give a fresh perspective and uncover unexplored avenues for business improvement. 

## Wrapping Up 

At the end of the day, every business is unique and requires a unique touch. While AI writing is a fascinating technological feat, nothing beats the authenticity of a human touch. It is the balance of using AI's efficiency and human's creativity that makes a compelling business story. Having an outside opinion can help identify new opportunities for improvement. And who knows? You might just pen the next bestseller with a dash of AI and a sprinkle of human touch. Now that's a plot twist!

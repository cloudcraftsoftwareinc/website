## How Do You Automate a Digital Marketing Business?

Automation, in the context of digital marketing for small businesses, is about streamlining recurring tasks to free up your time for more strategic work. This often involves leveraging various tools and technology, from social media schedulers to automated email marketing campaigns. However, while these tools bring undeniable benefits, they're not one-size-fits-all solutions. Your business is unique, and sometimes, you need an outside eye to help tailor a strategy that fits your specific needs.

Often, the question isn’t whether to automate, but rather what to automate and how to implement this effectively. Our deep dive today will focus on these questions.

## The Benefits of Automation

When done right, automation can save you time, reduce errors, and help you focus on your business's more unique and creative aspects. Time-consuming tasks such as social media postings, newsletters, and email marketing can all be simplified with automation, but it's essential not to overlook your business's unique touch.

More than generic scheduling tools, you might find that simpler custom solutions that are catered to your business needs offer the greatest benefits. Let's take a quick look at some of these tools:

### Some Automation Solutions for Small Businesses

 * Hootsuite and Buffer for scheduling social media posts
 * MailChimp for automating email marketing campaigns
 * Google Workspace for automating business operations like calendars and customer relations
 * Simple keyword-based bots for automating customer service interactions. 

## Custom Solutions and the Role of Consultation

However, each tool carries its own complexity and needs to be configured correctly to truly benefit your business. This is where consultation comes into play. A consultant, with their outside perspective and expertise, can help assess your business and match you to the tools that best serve your needs.

A good consultant also recognizes the value of sometimes forgoing 'all-in-one' tools for custom and simpler solutions honed for a particular business. Examples of this may include:

### Custom Webpage Automation Tools

 * QuickyCMS for site management
 * CartFlows for sales funnels
 * Wordpress plugins for SEO 
 * Formidable Forms for complex forms and surveys.

## Which Aspects of Your Business Should You Automate?

"To automate or not to automate, that is the question." Or rather, are you automating the aspects of your business that will yield the highest benefits? There's a delicate balance to be struck here. Let's explore this further:

While routine tasks like reminders, scheduling, and bulk emails could be automated, areas requiring personal touch like customer complaints and feedback should still receive your attention. Here are some other areas that usually stand to gain from automation:

### Potential Areas for Automation

 * Advertising on Google and social media platforms
 * Data gathering and analysis
 * Personalized communication based on customer history
 * E-mail and social media responses for common questions. 

## Weighing the Pros and Cons

Finally, it's crucial to consider the pros and cons of automation. Every decision has trade-offs, and automation is no different. You might save time, but you also face the risk of appearing impersonal or vendor lock-in with your chosen tool.

Ultimately, understanding these trade-offs and balancing automation with personal attention forms the crux of effective digital marketing automation.

### Weighing Pros and Cons

 * Pros: Time savings, efficiency, and reduced human error.
 * Cons: Potential loss of personal touch, cost of automation, training time for new tools.

## Wrapping Things Up

Automation is a powerful tool for digital marketing businesses, especially those run by small teams — or even just a single owner. The key lies in judiciously choosing what to automate and keeping a balance between efficiency and maintaining that human touch. Often, expert consultation can help you navigate this landscape and tailor solutions most effectively to your unique business setup.

Remember, every business is different and what worked for one may not work for another. An outside opinion can often shed new light on overlooked opportunities. With automation, your business can become more efficient, allowing you to focus on the areas where you truly shine.

## What are three business objectives of creating an effective online presence?

At a fundamental level, creating an effective online presence for small businesses seeks to accomplish three key objectives. Firstly, it establishes credibility by providing a digital storefront that mirrors in-store professionalism. Secondly, it broadens market reach by making the business more accessible to consumers worldwide. Lastly, it aids in building and maintaining strong customer relationships. 

What about the projects or tasks that are overwhelming because they seem too techie or time-consuming? The reality is, we can sometimes get stuck on the 'how' and miss the big picture. Let's break things down.

## Credibility

In this digital age, consumers often research a business online prior to making purchases or choosing services. The absence of a professional website can raise red flags. On the other hand, a well-designed online presence speaks volumes about who you are, what you offer, and why you're a trusted choice.

Think about your own online shopping habits—would you trust a business that lacks an online presence?

### Cultivating credibility involves:

 * Fine-tuning a compelling brand story 
 * Showcasing quality product/service images 
 * Highlighting positive customer testimonials 
 * Providing clear and concise business information

## Market Reach

An online platform helps to overcome geographical barriers, allowing small businesses to engage a broader market—not confined only to local customers, but open to consumers worldwide. 

Imagine the growth potential if you could reach customers across the globe!

### Extending your market reach includes:

 * Adopting SEO strategies to improve visibility 
 * Exploring eCommerce for product-based businesses
 * Using digital advertising to target specific demographics 
 * Participating in relevant online communities 

## Customer Relationship

An effective online presence allows businesses to interact directly with customers, cultivating stronger relationships. A business can instantly address customer queries, share new offerings, or gauge customer satisfaction. 

Have you ever been impressed by a business's prompt online response?

### Strengthening customer relationships involves:

 * Implementing interactive features such as live chats, forums
 * Regularly updating customers via newsletters, blog posts
 * Responding promptly to customer inquiries and feedback 
 * Providing exclusive online promotions or rewards

## So where to start?

## What is the Cheapest Form of Digital Marketing?

Digital marketing can be a cost-effective way for small businesses to reach a larger audience. Email marketing, in particular, is generally considered one of the most affordable and effective types of digital marketing. But let’s dig deeper into this and other cost-efficient strategies.

Think of your business needs first. What type of audience are you trying to reach? What are your goals? Only then can you determine which form of digital marketing will be the most inexpensive, yet effective for your specific needs.

## Email Marketing

Possibly the most cost-effective digital marketing strategy is email marketing. It allows for constant communication with your customer base, providing updates on deals, new products, or your company’s latest news. But remember, it's not only about price, but about building and maintaining customer relationships.

Email marketing tools such as MailChimp, AWeber, or Constant Contact also offer free or very reasonably priced plans, especially for small businesses. These tools provide templates, analytics and other features which helps in automation and keeping a professional touch.

### Key Points about Email Marketing

 * Affordable tool (often free for small databases)
 * Direct communication with customers
 * Easy to use and automate
 * Enables tracking and analytics

## Social Media Marketing

Another cost-effective strategy is social media marketing. Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter allow businesses to directly engage with customers and create a community around their brand.

This doesn't mean that businesses should invest in every social network. It's crucial to understand your customer base and where they spend most of their online time. While Instagram may work best for a retail store targeting younger customers, a service-based business might find more success on LinkedIn.

### Key Points about Social Media Marketing

 * Multiple platforms, choose according to your customers
 * Direct and engaged communication with customers
 * Platforms often offer free business tools
 * Encourages sharing and extend reach

## Content Marketing

Content marketing is another efficient method, providing valuable, relevant content to your audience. This can come in the form of articles, blogs, videos, or infographics.

Content marketing tools like Canva for design, Buzzsumo for content ideas and WordPress for content publication also offer free or low-cost options. The trick here is not the cost, but the time invested in creating meaningful content.

### Important Features of Content Marketing

 * Share valuable information
 * Build trust and authority
 * Boost SEO
 * Requires a time investment

## SEO: The Hidden Weapon

SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is the key strategy for improving your website’s ranking in search engine results. It is a long-term investment and might not show immediate results, but when properly managed, SEO can provide exposure and traffic over time without huge monetary investments.

Key elements include relevant keywords, a user-friendly website, and high-quality links. Tools like Google Analytics or Yoast SEO can provide crucial insights and optimization suggestions at little to no cost.

## Final Words

While these digital marketing tools offer cost-effective solutions, it's important to remember that no solution is one-size-fits-all. Every business is unique, and their chosen strategies should not only be cost-effective but also align with their specific goals and audiences. Having an outsider's perspective could potentially help to identify overlooked opportunities. That's enough for today but remember, it's not always about finding the cheapest solution, it's about finding the most effective one for your business.

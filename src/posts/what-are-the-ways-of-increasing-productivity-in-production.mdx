Often, small businesses spend a great chunk of their time performing manual, repetitive tasks. 

Automation can help businesses save hours each day. Platforms like Mailchimp automate your email marketing, while tools like Hootsuite and Buffer assist in automating social media posts. Furthermore, accounting software like QuickBooks provides automation features for tasks such as invoice generation.

## Implement Flexible Work Models 

In recent times, the traditional concept of a 9-5 job has evolved. Small businesses can benefit from flexible work schedules. This can not only boost morale, but also leads to improved productivity as team members work during their peak productivity hours.

### Models to Explore 

 * Remote work setups
 * Compressed work weeks

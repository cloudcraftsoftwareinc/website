## What are the six most common social media campaign strategies?

Social media campaign strategies are diverse and plentiful, but there are six that stand out as the most common: user-generated content, influencer partnerships, contests and giveaways, cause or event promotion, branded hashtags, and 'behind-the-scenes' content. These six strategies can be powerful tools for small businesses seeking to engage with their audiences and promote their products or services.

It's important to remember, though, that not all strategies will suit every business. Each requires different resources, fosters different types and levels of engagement, and may resonate more or less with varying audience demographics.

## User-Generated Content

User-generated content (UGC), like reviews, testimonials, or customer photos, can create a sense of community between a business and its customers. It allows clients to see how others are interacting with your product or service, offering trust-building social proof.

However, encouraging and managing UGC can be time-consuming. Balancing its benefits with the necessary time and effort is a key consideration.

### Examples of User-Generated Content

 * Starbucks' #RedCupContest, inviting customers to share holiday-themed pictures.
 * GoPro’s user photo of the day, featured on social media pages.
 * Airbnb’s experiences shared by travelers.
 * Fitness brands' transformation stories.

## Influencer Partnerships

Influencer partnerships involve collaborating with individuals who have a significant social following. These collaborations often involve influencers promoting a product or service, or participating in brand events or content.

Such partnerships can rapidly expand your brand's reach, but finding, negotiating, and managing relationships with influencers can be challenging.

### Examples of Influencer Partnerships

 * Glossier's collaborations with influencers for product demos.
 * Daniel Wellington watches promoted by numerous influencers.
 * HelloFresh partnering with fitness influencers.
 * Fashion Nova's vast network of Instagram models.

## Contests and Giveaways

Contests and giveaways can boost customer engagement and drive sales. They can range from simple like-and-share contests to more complex creative competitions.

While they can generate buzz and engagement, such strategies can also attract one-time participants who may not remain engaged in the long term.

### Examples of Contests and Giveaways 

 * Domino’s Piece of the Pie Contest, giving a chance to win a year of free pizza.
 * Lush Cosmetics' various Instagram giveaway campaigns.
 * REI's product giveaways for adventure photos.
 * Netflix's Narcos-related contest, promoting a new season.

## Cause or Event Promotion

Promoting involvement in a cause or event can humanize a brand and build customer rapport. Though it depends on a business's type and ethos, this strategy can foster a deeper connection with customers.

Proceeding with sensitivity is key here, though, as appearing insincere or exploitative can drastically harm your brand's reputation.

### Examples of Cause or Event Promotion 

 * TOMS Shoes' 'One for One' campaign.
 * REI's #OptOutside campaign for Black Friday.
 * Starbucks' 'Race Together' campaign.
 * Everlane's commitment to ethical production.

## Branded Hashtags

Branded hashtags can turn customers into brand advocates, promoting your products or services to their own followers. This can increase brand recognition, reach and audience engagement.

Yet, without commitment to maintaining an active and engaging social presence, branded hashtags can easily lose their momentum.

### Examples of Branded Hashtags

 * Coca-Cola’s #ShareACoke campaign.
 * Charmin’s #TweetFromTheSeat hashtag.
 * Lays' #DoUsAFlavor campaign.
 * Tiffany & Co.'s #WillYou campaign.

## 'Behind-The-Scenes' Content

Sharing 'behind-the-scenes' content, like footage of product creation or staff introductions, offers an intimate look into your business. It can build trust and deepen customer relationships. 

Yet, this strategy also relies heavily on building an established, engaged audience to be effective.

### Examples of 'Behind-The-Scenes' Content

 * Buffer's transparency reports and team profiles.
 * Chobani factory tours via Instagram Stories.
 * Barre Fitness' posts featuring their instructors.
 * Etsy's shop owner highlights.

## Understanding Your Business's Unique Needs 

Each of these strategies possesses strengths and potential challenges. Understanding your business's unique context, resources, and audience can help identify which will deliver the most value. Engage with a third party consultant to get an unbiased perspective on the way forward. The optimal strategy may even encompass elements of multiple approaches. As always, it's important to test, iterate, experiment, and adapt your approach based on feedback and results.

That's it for today's lesson in social media campaign strategies. Remember, every business is unique and requires a unique touch, and sometimes an outside opinion can help identify new opportunities for improvement. But do remember, any strategy will be most effective when it authentically represents your brand and its values.

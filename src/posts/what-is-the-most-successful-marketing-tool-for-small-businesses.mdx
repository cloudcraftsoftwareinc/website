## Understanding Your Business

Small businesses often lack the resources to compete with larger corporations. Therefore, they must employ unique marketing strategies that will make them stand out from the crowd.

Every business is unique with its own set of strengths and limitations. Identifying these can help tailor a marketing strategy that plays to your strengths and mitigates your weaknesses.

### Key Takeaways

 * Understand your business landscape

 * Tailor your strategy accordingly

## Selecting the Right Tools

Choosing the right digital marketing tools is a critical part of any small business marketing strategy. However, the sheer array of options available can be overwhelming.

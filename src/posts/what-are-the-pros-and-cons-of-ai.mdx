AI or Artificial Intelligence has both merits and demerits when deployed in small businesses. While it enables businesses to automate tasks and enhance decision-making, costs and the need for technical acumen can be barriers. Let's dive deeper into this complex space.

## Pros of AI in Small Businesses

AI can transform the way small businesses function. It offers benefits like never before, initiating a new era of growth and efficiency.

One of the most significant advantages of AI for small businesses is its ability to automate routine tasks. Several day-to-day activities such as answering customer queries, scheduling appointments, or managing social media updates can be easily taken over by AI, freeing up time for business owners to focus on strategic initiatives.

### Some Useful AI Tools 

 * Wixâ€™s AI website builder to design websites.
 * Grammarly's AI platform to refine content.
 * Google Analytics' AI for site traffic analysis.
 * Salesforce's Einstein AI CRM for customer relationship management. 

## Cons of AI in Small Businesses

While the allure of AI is undeniable, small businesses also face hurdles. Let's discuss some of the more prevalent roadblocks. 

A primary challenge is the high costs associated with implementing AI. For small and medium enterprises, investing in AI technology may pose a significant financial risk. Additionally, using AI effectively requires technical expertise - a resource smaller businesses typically lack.

### Some Potential Hurdles 

 * High development and maintenance costs.
 * Limited technical knowledge within the team.
 * Difficulty in adapting to new technology.
 * Uncertainty about the return on investment.

## The Role of Custom Solutions and External Consultants

<blockquote>A wise man said, 'Sometimes the solution isn't inside the box it came in.'</blockquote>

Often, AI presents itself in the form of robust, all-in-one platforms. While these may serve a comprehensive range of functionalities, they may not necessarily be the best fit for your unique business needs. Here's where customized solutions and external consultants can have a profound impact. 

Companies such as Cloudcraft create tailored solutions, matching the business needs accurately and efficiently. Third-party analysis can often outperform traditional, in-box solutions when it comes to deriving value, saving time, and delivering results.

### What to Look For in a Consultant 

 * Technical expertise in AI and related fields.
 * Capacity to understand your unique business ramifications.
 * Track record of successful AI implementations.
 * Flexibility to work within your budget constraints. 

## Wrapping Up

Every business is unique, so a one-size-fits-all AI strategy is rarely the most effective. Consulting with an external expert can shed light on new opportunities and provide bespoke solutions that best fit your needs. Because in the end, it's about utilizing technology to enhance your unique business, not fitting your business into the mould of technology.

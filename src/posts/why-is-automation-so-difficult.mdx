## Simplifying Automation: The Role of a Consultant

<blockquote>Complexity is complexity, regardless of your architecture. It is important to find a solution that suits you and not just following the trend.</blockquote>

Deciding what tasks to automate and how to do it can be thorny. This is where a consultant comes into play. They can guide you to prioritize processes for automation, set achievable goals and provide an outside perspective on what may work best for your unique business.

Consultants can bring a fresh perspective, help you navigate through different options, and customize a plan just for you.

## Challenge of Training

Every change in operation comes with a learning curve and staff training. Introducing automation in the workplace could initially slow things down before speeding things up. Patience, well-structured training programs and support from software providers can alleviate this burden significantly.

### Things to consider:

 * Schedule timely training sessions
 * Ensure proper documentation for the software
 * Get technical support from the software provider
 * Be patient; it takes time to adapt to new processes

Remember, every small business is unique, requiring a unique solution and having an outside opinion can help identify new opportunities for improvement.

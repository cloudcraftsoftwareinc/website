## What is AI that Improves a Business?

Artificial Intelligence (AI), in the context of supporting small businesses, is a set of technologies designed to automate mundane tasks and processes, streamline operations, and provide actionable insights to help businesses owners focus more on their core competencies and creative initiatives.

As the digital landscape evolves and businesses increasingly have to juggle multiple aspects, AI technologies can take the burden off their shoulders and simplify the day-to-day runnings.

## The Role of AI in Small Businesses

AI brings multiple benefits to small service and retail businesses with a small workforce. By harnessing AI, businesses can automate aspects like customer service, social media posting, and even email communications.

For instance, think of chatbots on a retail website, responding to customer inquiries. Or a schedule management tool that automates appointment settings. Better yet, a social media tool that recommends the most optimal times to post based on past engagement. 

### Examples of AI

 * AI Chatbots - Can simulate human interactions for customer service
 * Email automation systems - EA can send personalised reminders or updates to customers
 * Social media automation tools - SMAT auto-schedule posts based on optimal time
 * AI-based analytic tools - ABAT make sense of data for informed decision making

## The Simple Approach over Packaged Tools

Giant tech companies often sell "all-in-one" solutions targeting small businesses. While these packaged tools might seem tempting, they often come loaded with features that you may never use. Here's where a simple, custom solution proves more valuable.

Caution should be exerted regarding claims of 'AI capabilities.' The term has increasingly become a marketing gimmick, leaving many disillusioned. Sorting through the noise, understanding your exact requirements, and developing a solution around those needs is the way to go.

## Why Consultation Makes the Difference

Remember, no one knows your business better than you do! So, engage with a consultant who can bring in an outside perspective, helping evaluate your unique business needs and providing insights into what tools will deliver the highest value.

They say it takes a village to raise a child - and the same applies to businesses. Collaborating with experts who can provide a fresh perspective might be just what you need to take the next step in your AI journey.

## The Power of Custom Solutions
 
Custom solutions offer a level of versatility and customization that standard options just can't match. By working closely with consultants who understand the nuances of your business, you can have a system that's tailor-made to cater to your unique requirements.

### Some Custom Solution Providers

 * Zoho - a cloud software suite designed for businesses
 * QuickBooks - an AI accounting software for small businesses
 * MailChimp - a marketing automation platform, especially for email marketing
 * Airtable - combines elements of spreadsheets and databases for unique task management

## Wrapping Up and Looking Forward

The emergence of AI for business use holds the potential to be a game-changer in the retail and service industry. By harnessing these technologies wisely, small businesses under 10 staff members can keep ahead of the game. However, always approach AI implementation with a level of caution and due diligence. And remember, every business is unique and requires a unique touch. Never shy away from seeking an outside opinion to help identify new opportunities for improvement.

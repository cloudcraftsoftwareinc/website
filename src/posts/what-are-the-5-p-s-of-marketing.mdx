Understanding your product is critical; you need to determine what sets your product apart from your competitors. Is it more affordable, of better quality, or does it offer a unique experience? 

Additionally, you should remember that your product continually evolves over time. Hence, ensuring your product's evolution aligns with your customers' changing needs and experiences is an aspect of Product you must not ignore.

## Promotion

Promotion involves the strategies you use to communicate with your customers and potential clients about your product/service. This includes advertising, public relations, social media marketing, email marketing, search engine optimization (SEO), and more. 

Promotion is all about ensuring people are aware of your product/service and compelling them to engage with your business. Crafting a successful promotional strategy requires understanding your target market and choosing the right combination of promotional tactics to reach and engage them.

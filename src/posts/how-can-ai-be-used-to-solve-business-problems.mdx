## How Can AI Be Used To Solve Business Problems?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not just for multinational corporations. In fact, it can be a powerful tool for small business owners, helping to automate mundane tasks, personalize customer service, and unlock new insights from your data—ultimately saving you precious time and resources.

## Making Sense of AI

Understanding AI can be a daunting task, especially with all the complexity and jargon thrown around. In it's most basic form, AI is all about automating decisions and tasks that usually require human intelligence—like sorting emails or interpreting customer sentiments. 

For small businesses, the goal is not to replace human employees but to augment their work, freeing them to engage in more strategic and creative tasks.

### A Few Key AI Applications

* E-commerce recommendation engines (such as Shopify's Product Recommendations)
* Social media sentiment analysis tools (like Hootsuite Insights)
* Automated customer service bots (eg. ActiveChat)
* Email marketing automation (like Mailchimp's AI-powered features)

## The 'DIY' vs 'Packaged' Dilemma

Business owners are often faced with a choice between custom building AI capabilities or choosing a pre-packaged tool. While building custom solutions gives more control to the business, it might require more time, resources, and technical knowledge—a luxury not all small businesses can afford. 

Pre-packaged solutions, while not always perfectly tailored for your specific needs, offer the advantage of quick and easy implementation, often coming with user-friendly interfaces and accessible support.

### Thanks to the advancements in technology, a plethora of effective tools have emerged for small businesses.

* Payment automation tools, like Stripe, that reduce the hassle of invoicing 
* Predictive analysis platforms, for example Smartsheet, that help in forecasting sales 
* AI-driven CRM tools, such as Salesforce's Einstein, enhancing customer relationships
* Social media automation tools like Buffer, easing content strategies 

## Steering Clear of Common Misconceptions

While AI is promising, it does not provide magic solutions to business problems. Complex problems still require careful attention, human insights, and business knowledge. Understanding that not all tasks are equally well-suited for automation is key.

Falling into the trap of thinking AI is everything can be alluring. Do remember, AI is not the solution but a tool that helps you arrive at solutions more efficiently.

## Engaging a Consultant

The question then arises, how can small business owners navigate this extensive and often confusing landscape of AI tools? This is where having an outside perspective can provide value. 

A consultant can help evaluate the business's unique needs, sift through available tools, and match the business with the most effective solutions. Not only is this process cost-efficient, it can save precious time and provide an unbiased, expert opinion.

### There are numerous consultants and agencies that could help

* Cognizant offers robust and customizable AI solutions
* Accenture provides extensive AI consulting services
* IBM Watson offers a blend of tools and consulting 
* McKinsey & Company for more high-level strategic AI consulting

## The Power of AI: In Summary

Whether adopting an off-the-shelf tool or engaging with a consultant, remember every business is unique. Whatever the choice, it should ultimately support the business's unique objectives and requirements. That's enough for now, until the next exploration.

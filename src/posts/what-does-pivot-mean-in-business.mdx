## What does pivot mean in business?

The concept of a 'pivot' in business refers to a strategic shift a company makes when they realize their current product or service, often, isn't meeting the market demand, or could potentially meet a bigger demand with a few adjustments. It's basically when a business decides to change its course of strategy midway. 

Now, this might seem like a dreaded situation - change is often uncomfortable, let alone in small businesses where one strategic move can make or break the whole company. However, pivoting isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's an opportunity to explore new horizons, perhaps ones that hold untapped potential for growth.

## Why does a business need to pivot?

The need to pivot arises out of a multitude of reasons - perhaps initial assumptions about the market were incorrect, maybe the customer needs changed over time, or possibly the competitive landscape demanded a shift. 

Sometimes, businesses discover a new customer segment that is more profitable than their original audience. This is where the 'pivot' comes in - adjusting the business strategy to cater to this new-found market potential.

### Key Reasons to Pivot

 * Change in market conditions
 * Discovery of new customer segment
 * Financial sustainability
 * Increased competition

## What does a pivot look like?

A pivot can manifest in many ways. It could be a change in the target demographic, a change in the product line, or even a change in the business model.

## What needs to be considered before pivoting?

Before you consider a pivot, it's important to understand it's not a shot in the dark. It's a strategic move that should be underpinned by thorough research and careful deliberation. 

"By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail" as the saying goes. The same notion applies to pivoting too. 

### Essential Considerations before Pivoting

 * Market research
 * Financial risk assessment
 * Competitive analysis
 * Customer feedback analysis

## Is pivot the ultimate solution?

Proposing a pivot as the ultimate solution would be a simplistic approach to solving business problems. Each situation is unique, as is each business. Sometimes, all it takes is adjusting your current operations instead of initiating an overhaul.

### Alternatives to Pivoting

 * Market Re-segmentation
 * Product EnhancementsÂ 
 * Operational Efficiency Improvement
 * Strategic Alliances

## Unpacking the complexities of a pivot

Pivoting your business strategy is a balanced act between recognizing the warning signs early enough and knowing exactly how you intend to execute the change. 

Remember, it's not a full-stop, but a comma in your journey, giving your narrative a chance to explore new ideas, while retaining the essence of what your business stands for. 

And that's enough for today! Don't forget, sometimes an outside opinion can provide a fresh perspective to help identify new opportunities for improvement. Take care and good luck with your business endeavors!

## Which ads are cheaper Google or Facebook?

Google and Facebook, two prominent players in digital advertising, each offer different approaches with the potential for different returns. In general terms, Facebook advertising can present a more economical option given its lower Average Cost Per Click (CPC). However, the cost-efficiency fundamentally depends on your business goals, target audience, and tailored strategies that leverage the unique strengths of each platform.

Entering into the world of digital advertising can seem daunting, especially with a multitude of platforms and methods available. Google and Facebook advertising both provide viable paths to reach potential customers, but understanding their cost structure is essential to making the best decision for your unique business.

## Key Cost Factors 

Regardless of the platform you choose, several common factors can influence the cost of your digital ads. 

The nature of your industry and product, the competition within your market, and the specific demographic you want to reach, all play a role in determining how much you'll spend.  

### Here are some common elements:

 * Type of industry
 * Market competition
 * Geographic location
 * Demographic targets 

## Google AdWords: A Closer Look

Google AdWords operates as an auction, where advertisers bid on keywords relevant to their business. 

The cost greatly depends on the competitiveness of those keywords. However, the expensive nature of popular keywords often reflects the high intent of Google users, which could result in higher conversion. 

### Variables leading to cost fluctuations:

 * Keyword competition
 * Ad Quality Score
 * User behaviour
 * Time of advertising

## Facebook Ads: A Detailed Perspective

Facebook advertising is driven by a broader socio-demographic targeting approach. 

The cost here varies with factors like ad quality, relevancy score, and competition within your targeting options. Although it can be cheaper than Google, the lower costs need to be balanced against the typically lower intent of Facebook users.

### Factors driving the cost:

 * Ad format choice 
 * Bid amount 
 * Time of advertising 
 * User targeting

## Consider the Bigger Picture

<blockquote> "A penny saved is a penny earned."</blockquote>

Yet, in the realm of digital advertising, the cheapest option isn't always the best. Consider the potential value and return on your ad spend, rather than simply the upfront costs. It can sometimes be more advantageous to spend a little more for ads designed to reach a more engaged or targeted audience.

## Final Thoughts

Both Google AdWords and Facebook ads offer unique advantages depending on your business needs and goals. 

While Facebook might come out ahead in terms of cheaper costs, focusing solely on this aspect might mean missing out on the higher-intent audience that Google can offer. 

### Essential points to remember:

 * Quality, not just quantity, matters when reaching audiences
 * Consider the customer's intent
 * Tailor strategy to business goals
 * Review and adjust regularly

In the grand scheme of things, every business is unique and requires a unique digital advertising strategy. Involving an external perspective, especially from those well versed in both platforms, can help identify new opportunities for your business. So, perhaps it's not a question of Google vs. Facebook but rather, how can Google and Facebook work best for you?

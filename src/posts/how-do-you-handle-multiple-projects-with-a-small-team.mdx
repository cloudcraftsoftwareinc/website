## How do you handle multiple projects with a small team?

Juggling various projects with a minimal workforce is indeed a challenge. Nonetheless, it can be masterfully accomplished with proper planning, effective communication, and a bit of savvy tech usage. We'll delve into these techniques and many more, examining success strategies and potential pitfalls.

Pause for a moment, though. Have you ever considered how taking a consultant's perspective might help you navigate these waters? In the end, it's all about asking the right questions and finding tailor-made answers.

## The Art of Prioritizing

Handling various projects with a small team revolves around the ability to prioritize effectively. Assess your projects based on their urgency, deadline proximity, and the resources they require. Highlight the team's capacity and the financial implications of each project.

Conversely, it's just as crucial to recognize when certain tasks donâ€™t need to be addressed immediately. Sometimes, it's ok to say, "This can wait."

### Prioritizing tools:

 * Asana: Use it to monitor and assign tasks within your team.
 * Slack: A great tool for fast, seamless communication.
 * Trello: A visual way to look at ongoing projects.
 * Google Calendar: Use it to set alerts and reminders for deadlines.

## Embrace Technology 

Technology can play a significant role in making small teams more efficient. Tools like Asana, Slack, and others, make project management smoother. However, adopting automation too ambitiously can sometimes complicate things.

Remember, finding the right balance is key. A simple, customized solution sometimes achieves better results than a feature-loaded, all-in-one package.

## Delegate Wisely

<blockquote>We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give - Winston Churchhill</blockquote>

Delegation is more than just offloading tasks. It involves entrusting your team with responsibilities that best fit their skill sets. Remember, trust fosters ownership and motivates the team to play an active role in achieving goals 

There is a thin line, however, between delegating and shifting all your work onto other team members. The key point is to avoid task dumping.

## Nurturing Communication

Managing multiple projects with a small team calls for a clear and open line of communication. Keeping everyone abreast of updates, changes, and any hitches encountered can streamline workflows and imply fewer interrupted workdays.

### Affable communication tools:

 * Zoom: Offers video conferencing and screen sharing.
 * Chanty: A team-based messaging app with task tracking.
 * Dropbox: Use it to store, share, and sync files.
 * Google GSuite: Provides communication and collaboration tools.

## Wrapping It Up

In this whirlwind of project management jargon, it's clear that every business is a unique entity. Each project demands a balance of assertiveness, negotiation, and leadership, matched with the right suite of tools. 

And remember, having an outside perspective, like that of a consultant, can help you identify new opportunities for improvement and essential technologies that will streamline your processes. That's all for today. Happy project handling!

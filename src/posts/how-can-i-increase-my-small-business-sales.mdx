## The Power of Customer Service

Exceptional customer service can turn first time customers into loyal patrons. To this end, small businesses often have an advantage over large corporations because of their ability to interact individually with each customer.

Investing in quality communication tools and training your staff to render effective customer service can multiply your sales numbers dramatically.

### Customer Service Strategies Examples:

 * Introducing a chatbot (like Drift or Intercom)
 * Using customer relationship management software (like Zoho)
 * Hosting webinars and educational content (Tools like Zoom)
 * Regular follow-ups via emails or phone calls using CRMs.

## Exploiting Technology

Technology can greatly improve how small businesses operate. Embracing automation for repetitive tasks, using digital platforms for marketing, and providing online services are just a few ways technology can increase your sales.

Remember, however, the debate of 'all-in-one' solutions versus custom solutions. While 3rd party solutions may seem tempting, simple, custom solutions can be more fitting for your unique business needs. 

### Technology Adoption Examples in Business:

 * Automate repetitive tasks (like Zendesk for customer care)
 * Use digital marketing tools (like Google Ads or Facebook Marketing)
 * Upgrade to cloud services (like Microsoft Azure)
 * Develop or upgrade to a user-friendly website.

## Narrate a Clear Brand Story

Your brand's narrative is crucial to your business's success. A well-narrated story can create a lasting connection with your customers. 

<blockquote> "A brand is no longer what we tell the consumer it is â€“ it is what consumers tell each other it is." - Scott Cook, Co-founder of Intuit </blockquote>

So, the better your story, the better the customer engagement, leading to increased sales. In this era of increased digitization, a clear online presence is essential. 

### Creating a Compelling Brand Story Examples:

 * Invest in good quality website design (like WordPress templates)
 * Actively engage on social media platforms (tools like Hootsuite can help)
 * Publish and promote useful and engaging blog posts (WordPress or Ghost)
 * Use email marketing for personalized storytelling (MailChimp has great tools for this).

## That's enough for today!

Ultimately, each business is unique and requires a tailored approach. While theses provide a general guideline, having an outside perspective can really help identify new opportunities for improvement. Monetizing your unique qualities through good service, strategic use of technology, and clear branding can skyrocket your small businesses' sales while still keeping a very personal touch that small businesses provide.

## How AI can be used in small business?

As small business owners, access to viable business solutions plays a pivotal role in the growth and success of the venture. AI technology can be utilized in a myriad of ways to deliver value, create efficiencies, and drive small businesses towards success.

## Administrative Automation

In many small businesses, day-to-day administrative work can often be time-consuming and burdensome. Thanks to AI, it's now possible to automate many of these tasks. Tools like Microsoft Power Automate and Zoho Flow leverage automation for daily tasks, freeing up valuable time for business owners.

But is automation always the best solution? While these tools provide excellent services, they might not be the best fit for each unique business operations.

### Automation Tools Checklist

 * Microsoft Power Automate
 * Zoho Flow
 * IFTTT
 * Zapier
  
## Enhancing Customer Experience

AI can play a key role in enhancing the customer experience by providing personalized services. AI technologies, such as chatbots, can create personalized conversations with customers—answering questions and providing recommendations. Platforms like Chatfuel and Drift are building sophisticated bots that can interact with customers in a conversationally nuanced manner.

However, a unique in-house service may deliver a better customer experience than one-size-fits-all chatbots. Therefore, consider both benefits and limitations when choosing solution providers.

## Data-Driven Decision Making

By analyzing data and predicting trends, AI can enable small businesses to make data-driven decisions. Tools such as Tableau and Looker can help businesses to gain valuable insights, identify patterns and anticipate future scenarios.

"Experience is a master teacher, even when it’s not our own." Aligning business decisions with data significantly reduces associated risks and offers a competitive edge. However, the value derived from these insights largely depends on their applicability to the specific business model.

### Data Tools for Businesses

 * Tableau
 * Looker
 * Google Analytics
 * Microsoft Power BI

## Overall Summary 

To wrap things up, it's important to realize the potential upside of using AI in small businesses. The possibilities are vast, from automating routine tasks to enhancing customer experiences, and informing decisions with data insights. Each business is unique and requires a unique approach. An external consultant could help navigate and pinpoint specific opportunities, delivering optimal business value. And remember, the best solution isn't always the most technically complex. Sometimes, simpler custom solutions can outperform bulky inclusive ones.

## What Tool Should You Use To Keep Track For A Small Project With Two Team Members?

When managing small projects with a modest team, a simple, custom solution often works best. Today, I'll shed light on tools that can help drive efficiency without adding undue complexity.

Let's ask some more probing questions. How big is too big? When does a simple project become a complex one? Let's unravel these enigmas.

## The Diverse Landscape of Project Management Tools

There are a myriad of project management tools out there. Some are intricate, catering to large organizations, while others, like Trello, Asana, or even a shared Google Sheets, are designed with simplicity in mind. 

But make no mistake, simple does not equate to lack of robustness. Even relatively easy-to-use tools can still offer in-depth features that enable detailed project tracking if correctly utilized.

### Key Features To Look For

 * Intuitive interface
 * Task and subtask tracking
 * Time tracking
 * Collaboration and Communication features
 * Customizable workflow

## A Case for Simplicity

While an abundance of all-singing-all-dancing tools can tempt us, do we need them all? Here is where having an outsider's perspective is worthwhile. Consultants can be swift and cost-effective, answering technology questions and matching your business with suitable solutions.

Let's be honest here, complexity does not bring about competence. Rather than just adding more features, we should aim to solve real problems.

### Examples of Simple But Effective Tools

 * Trello for the Kanban lovers
 * Asana for the deadline-drivers
 * Slack for seamless communication
 * Google Sheets for the budget-conscious

## The Complexity of Decisions

<blockquote>Complexity is complexity, regardless of your architecture</blockquote>

It's essential to not get distracted by the bells and whistles of a tool but instead focus on how it can serve your unique needs. Does it make your life easier or more complicated? 

No two businesses will have the same answer to these questions. What works for one doesn't necessarily mean it will work for the other.

## It's All About Your Needs, Really

The phrase 'One size fits all' doesn't really apply when it comes to software. Different tools cater to distinct project sizes, types, and styles of working. We need to make our decisions based on individual needs rather than industry popularity.

### Popular Tools That Can Work Wonders

 * Dropbox for file sharing
 * Zoom for virtual meetups
 * G Suite for collaboration
 * Evernote for note-taking

## Wrapping Up the Conversation on Tools

Ultimately, the choice of tools boils down to your specific needs and circumstances. Remember, every business is unique and requires a unique touch. An outside opinion can identify new opportunities for improvement, and sometimes, a simpler, custom solution can be more effective. 

Ah, that seems enough for today! Don't forget, success and learning within engineering teams stem from team dynamics, discipline, and critical thinking over any specific tool or methodology. Let's continue the conversation next time. Till then, keep exploring possibilities and staying curious.

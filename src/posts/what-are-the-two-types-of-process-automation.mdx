## What are the Two Types of Process Automation?

Process automation, a buzzing term in today's digital world, typically comes in two forms: task automation and process automation. These enable a small business to mechanize standard tasks, freeing up time and resources. 

Before jumping in, it's worthwhile for owner/operators to ask themselves: 'Which type is most relevant for my business?' and 'Will its implementation genuinely simplify the day-to-day?' Now, let’s delve deeper into this topic.

## Task Automation: The Basics

Task automation is all about converting manual tasks into automated ones. It's like hiring a virtual assistant, helping you to handle web scraping, social media posting, email broadcast, and so forth - tasks that are repeatable and predictable.

Small businesses can leverage tools like Hootsuite for social media posting, or Zapier to automate tasks across different applications. However, the choice of tool matters less than the understanding of the task and its context.

### Some Task Automation Tools to Consider

 * Hootsuite: For social media management.
 * Zapier: For integration between apps.
 * Constant Contact: For email marketing.
 * Asana: For project management.

## Process Automation: The Bigger Picture

Process automation takes a holistic approach and deals with automating entire workflows or business processes. It's like hiring an operations manager who optimizes processes for efficiency and reliability.

Tools like Shopify for online stores or Clover for retail point-of-sale systems are awesome for process automation. As with task automation, selection of the most viable tool should be dictated by individual business needs.

### Selecting the Right Tools for Your Business

 * Shopify: A comprehensive e-commerce platform.
 * Clover: POS system and payment processor.
 * Monday.com: For team management and collaboration.
 * Trello: For project tracking and management.

## The Scale of Automation

<blockquote tip>
"Automation should be embraced, but not for automation’s sake. Always keep in view the scale of your business and its authentic operational needs."
</blockquote>

Automation can be a huge boon for small businesses, but it's important to remember, it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. A task automation tool might be just the ticket for one business, while another might greatly benefit from a more comprehensive process automation setup.

## Outsourcing vs. In-House

Complexity contributes to the tug-of-war between in-house and outsourced solutions. Tools like FreshDesk or Intercom might provide great benefit, or perhaps a custom solution is more pertinent? Consulting a third-party can help uncover which approach is best for your needs.

### Third-party Automation Options

 * Intercom: For customer communication.
 * FreshDesk: For customer support ticketing.
 * Zendesk: Another customer service software contender.
 * Jira: For software development project management.

## Wrapping It All Up 

Every business is unique and deserves a solution that aligns with its individual needs and aspirations. An outside perspective can help identify new opportunities and maintain objectivity. Always evaluate automation in line with your business’s true needs. Remember, complexity is complexity, regardless of your architecture. Enjoy the simplicity that automation can bring, but do so with a discerning mind.

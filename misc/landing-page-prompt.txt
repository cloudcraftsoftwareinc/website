Generate an article in MDX using this question: "How do I stay healthy?"

The grey matter should contain title, description, author (Aaron Fay) and "image: 'todo'". focus on small business owners, so no content about industrial practices like robotics, focus more on owner/operators or small businesses that have less that 10 staff and would be in the retail or service industry.

The body should only contain h2 and smaller headings. Make the first heading the exact input question, the and the first paragraph a summarized answer that will be explored further in depth in the rest of the article. Only output the MDX content, no summary. Render the `<GetStartedBlurb />` and `<ServicesBlurb />` items exaclty as they are so they will be picked up in the final MDX output.

Use this template as a guide for the output, following the additional prompt information in angle bracket <>:
